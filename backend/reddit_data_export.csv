At that point, you can leave or you can give him a chance. I‚Äôd leave because to me, he already had the chance and took it for granted. If you let him fool you for a little while now.

He puts no effort in as my mom used to say ‚Äòwhy buy the cow when you get the milk for free‚Äô he‚Äôs getting what he wants from the relationship and you stay regardless of the little to zero effort he puts in. He won‚Äôt change unless he wants to and at the moment he has no reason to. Do yourself a favour and find the thoughtful man you are obviously better suited to. Good luck ! | 
Hey OP, sorry to hear you're going thru this. imho, it's much more than about chocolate. This seems about respect and effort. I'd sit him down, have a heart. If he's not willing to meet halfway, rethink your options. We only got one life. Don't settle for less than you deserve. Look out for your wellbeing. Best of luck! üëäüíîüç´üçÄ | 
Dude, IMO it looks like ur pouring ur all into this relationship while he's just coasting. Sure, things are tough, but that's when u gotta stick together rather than withdrawing, yk? Idk why he ain't taking ur needs seriously, but one sided sacrifices ain't cool. It sounds clich√©, but ur happiness matters too. Maybe it's time to have a serious talk or reconsider things. Life's too short to be stuck in an unhappy situation, so don't let past sacrifices hold you back. You got this üëç | NOR, he's a gaymer idiot. You moved to be with him, and he thanks you by treating you like an AI sex doll. You are right, a date can be free. The beach, the mall, a picnic, etc

I would make arragements to leave and don't look back, you've already gave him many chances. | Can you go back to your previous university and finish there?

NOR you are not an appliance, waiting for him to want to use you, and shouldn‚Äôt be treated as such. | How frustrating! NOR. You are very young and you've already given up so much for him, it must feel like releasing yourself from his grasp will mean that you sacrificed for nothing. It's never *nothing* to chose a wise course. It was unwise to set aside your studies for a man. Never make that mistake again. Now, go pick your life up and live it on your own, and keep your focus on your studies. When you're ready for a relationship, you'll find the right one. I don't think this relationship is right, and neither of you sound ready. | ""No matter how far you have walked down the wrong path, turn back."" | NOR. You can‚Äôt go back to your former university so focus on where you are. Find another living situation and finish your degree. 

It doesn‚Äôt feel great but the good thing is you learned really young not to sacrifice your goals for a relationship. Some people throw away all sorts of opportunities because their partner wants them to. But a good relationship will support you- for example it‚Äôs not surprising that your boyfriend was fine with you losing years of school. Someone who really cared would have encouraged you to finish before moving. | I think he only wanted you to be with him for sex. Please leave this relationship. You deserve better! 

Remember that the clock moves forward, so invest your time in something better. | You need to move out. Never give up your goals for anyone. | Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy. You can learn from this mistake and move forward a stronger person.You deserve someone who puts you first! | 
Man, sounds like you're in a rough spot. IMO, it‚Äôs all about mutual respect and effort, and it seems like he's not putting in his fair share here. He needs to figure his crap out or you gotta find someone who truly sees your worth. Life‚Äôs too short to settle for any less. Stay strong, op! üí™üèΩüî• | You need to leave him. | This is one of those time ima be tht guy and say ‚ÄúEND IT‚Äù! | Move on he is disrespecting you. | 20 is still so young. Don‚Äôt sacrifice the rest of your life because you‚Äôve already given things up for him. | NOR
If you don't mean enough for him to show you he cares, it's not a relationship: its a situationship. Yuck

The mature thing would be to tell him exactly how his actions and lack of make you feel amd that you az a person deserve better in a relationship.  and Ask him if he is willing to do better. If not say goodbye.

Get your own place, set yourself up like you had before him without having to micr to a different country. | Raisins?!

I think a lot of people perceive Wormwood as a farming character, with a lot of utility to simplify a task that most people don‚Äôt seem to enjoy very much. However, after playing him solo for a while, I feel like farming is barely useful for him, for one reason in particular: Mushroom Planters.

Wormwood is an absolute master of mushrooms. He can mass produce Living Logs to craft and maintain the planters, he can make them yield more, and most importantly, he can use them to produce an unlim...",27,1758602017,"For my Wormwood playthroughs, I always build 8 Mushroom Planters in a nearby cave entrance (since then the mushrooms don't rot in winter) and only use Moon Shrooms. You just need a single trip to the Lunar Grotto in the caves to either kill a Mush Gnome or fell a Lunar Mushtree and you're good to go. 8 planted Moon Shrooms will yield, with all insight points, 48 shrooms back. So you get a full stack of shrooms and 8 additional that you can replant in the Mushroom Planters to grow the next batch. 

A full stack of Moon Shrooms restores 500 hunger, which is enough for over six days, as well as 400 sanity, removing all sanity issues. But, with the Moon Shroom Cloud talent, you also can crowd control countless enemies at once since it's basically a mini, localized Pan Flute area. It is the single most powerful and busted food in the entire game because of it!

I highly recommend this for any aspiring Wormwood players (: | He's my main because best skins and combat tbh - I dont farm, thought I'd enjoy the farming with him more because I garden irl haha

Funny thing about playing as him in pubs is most of the time half the people expects you to stay at base growing big crops and make logs, the other half gets annoyed when you do that - but never include wormwood players in any activities. lots of rusher-type ppl decline when I offered to help kill bosses or outright forbids me to go with them lol. | I just started playing Wormwood a week or so ago and he has been a blast. I managed to snag an amazing base location next to reeds, bee queen, pig king, a sinkhole, and some water so things are going great! | Try adding another planter or 2 of each shroom type, make some mushy cake and you won't be dragged down by drugs all the time. If there's one fix for drug side effects, it's more drugs. Speed ballin' plant guy. | Farmin' is for the birds, outside of yielding some warly stuffs. As stated in another comment, worm is the mushroom king and if you actually progress the game instead of being a base bitch you will have more meat than you know what to do with. Add a bird cage and you can heal an army with pierogi. 

My bearger bin (imo the best item in the game) usually only gets meaty stews, banana shakes, and flower salads. I typically store some jelly beans in there just for inventory management. The bin makes salads last around a year before going stale. I keep flowers bundled and cook them with freshly opened stone fruit (with slurtle slime or gun powder since they come out stacked for maximum freshness) as needed. Salads also heal beef for 160 a pop. Shakes for sanity. Stews for hunger. Sometimes I'll make honey hams or bacon n eggs because they last such a long time and wig gets jelly salads for sanity. Wurt gets figatoni, trail mix or fruit medley for health and figatoni, fist full of jam or the terribly inefficient dish, ratatouille for hunger (its constituents give more hunger value than eating them raw, but only cooked dishes are allowed in the bin.)

The time sink of farming will never entice me. | You're not groggy if you eat the Moon Shrooms as Wormwood, if that's what you mean.

But I'm glad you're getting this checked.  

They will most likely do a visual check of the area for obvious signs of hemorrhoids.    If that checks out, they'll probably start by treating you for that and refer you on for further tests to make sure it's not more serious.

A go pro up the ass sounds awful but in reality is your best bet for ruling out anything serious. Request a sedation (though it should be offered) and remember that everyone who cares about their health goes through it.   Docs and nurses do this procedure a lot and to them it's no different than any other medical test.   

Digital exams are used for prostate cancer and some vaginal/uterine exams.   They aren't useful for colon issues.

Explain your situation, what you're doing to get through it, and how that is helping. | Yeah, I don't really care how uncomfortable it is or embarrassing. I just want to be alive and do stupid stuff with my friends. 

I'm thinking it's hemorrhoids as well just because I had a very painful bowel movement and a pretty huge one, one time, and that's when the bleeding started. The pain is better, but I get the blood off and on, only once this month I've gotten it I think...?

I thought that since I‚Äôm going for the cheapest decent espresso machine and the cheapest flat burr grinder that the results will be mediocre. But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

You just need a single trip to the Lunar Grotto in the caves to either kill a Mush Gnome or fell a Lunar Mushtree and you're good to go. 8 planted Moon Shrooms will yield, with all insight points, 48 shrooms back. So you get a full stack of shrooms and 8 additional that you can replant in the Mushroom Planters to grow the next batch. 

A full stack of Moon Shrooms restores 500 hunger, which is enough for over six days, as well as 400 sanity, removing all sanity issues. But, with the Moon Shroom Cloud talent, you also can crowd control countless enemies at once since it's basically a mini, localized Pan Flute area.

I highly recommend this for any aspiring Wormwood players (: | He's my main because best skins and combat tbh - I dont farm, thought I'd enjoy the farming with him more because I garden irl haha

Funny thing about playing as him in pubs is most of the time half the people expects you to stay at base growing big crops and make logs, the other half gets annoyed when you do that - but never include wormwood players in any activities. lots of rusher-type ppl decline when I offered to help kill bosses or outright forbids me to go with them lol. | I just started playing Wormwood a week or so ago and he has been a blast. I managed to snag an amazing base location next to reeds, bee queen, pig king, a sinkhole, and some water so things are going great! | Try adding another planter or 2 of each shroom type, make some mushy cake and you won't be dragged down by drugs all the time. If there's one fix for drug side effects, it's more drugs. Speed ballin' plant guy. | Farmin' is for the birds, outside of yielding some warly stuffs. As stated in another comment, worm is the mushroom king and if you actually progress the game instead of being a base bitch you will have more meat than you know what to do with. Add a bird cage and you can heal an army with pierogi. 

My bearger bin (imo the best item in the game) usually only gets meaty stews, banana shakes, and flower salads. I typically store some jelly beans in there just for inventory management. The bin makes salads last around a year before going stale. I keep flowers bundled and cook them with freshly opened stone fruit (with slurtle slime or gun powder since they come out stacked for maximum freshness) as needed. Salads also heal beef for 160 a pop. Shakes for sanity. Stews for hunger. Sometimes I'll make honey hams or bacon n eggs because they last such a long time and wig gets jelly salads for sanity. Wurt gets figatoni, trail mix or fruit medley for health and figatoni, fist full of jam or the terribly inefficient dish, ratatouille for hunger (its constituents give more hunger value than eating them raw, but only cooked dishes are allowed in the bin.)

The time sink of farming will never entice me. | You're not groggy if you eat the Moon Shrooms as Wormwood, if that's what you mean. But yes, the Mushy Cakes are still useful for the Celestial Scion fight specifically, allowing you to ignore the heavy slow of the electrical field.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Otherwise any non-espresso focused flat burr with good alignment mechanism like 064s, Philos, etc or the Lagom Casa. 064s and Philos you can upgrade with SSP MP and other burr sets if that‚Äôs something you wanna play with. 

Though if the plan is to do many back to back drinks frequently, the Casa, 064s and some of the others may struggle to do many back to back drinks. If that‚Äôs the case consider Philos / Eureka Atom

DF54 probably does well too but no comment on switching back and forth, that‚Äôs an issue with many grinders.

As for machine, bambino plus will do well if you don‚Äôt want to nerd out, or the GCP with eventual PID / Dimmer / gagguino if you want it to last long and allow you to nerd out.",2025-09-23 08:57:32
78,what is specialty coffee,gaggiaclassic,Finally got my Gaggia classic and it‚Äôs better than I expected,"So I finally decided to add an espresso machine to my brewing gadgets. I thought that since I‚Äôm going for the cheapest decent espresso machine and the cheapest flat burr grinder that the results will be mediocre. But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

We stayed at Charter Hotel in downtown Seattle the night before the cruise. Lovely hotel and perfectly located pre-cruise. The next morning we took an Uber black car (so much luggage!) to Pier 66. It was around 10:00 am and we immediately found a porter and went in to the terminal. Checked in and waited in the Main room until maybe 11:00 am and began boarding. Very organized and orderly.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NCL) if you have any questions or concerns.* | Was on the Joy before you.  Loved every minute and yes that weather was spectacular for what it can usually be this time of year. | Happy to see the positivity! My husband and I were on the same cruise and same dates! I‚Äôve heard negative comments already, but really don‚Äôt have any to share! 

My only sad part is I got confused on our dining benefits and thought we had four specialty dinings included in total- not four per person! So we completely missed out on two nights of specialty dining opportunities! We had chosen Le Bistro where we ate outdoors on an at sea day (my absolute goal and choice) and it was the best experience ever! We got so lucky with the weather that I wasn‚Äôt even cold but the wait staff offered us blankets at least 3 separate times lol!! The second choice was tappenyaki. Honestly, we didn‚Äôt have bad experiences in the main dining room, I‚Äôm just sad to have missed out on sitting outside to eat once more because I totally would have during glacier bay. 

We got so lucky with the weather on our sailing! Everything I‚Äôve heard so far has implied other ships a day later or earlier in their various ports were dealing with bad weather and some even missed ports. I heard one missed Sitka during bad weather but they did tenders (instead of porting and shuttle bussing in). I heard others the day before our Ketchikan couldn‚Äôt port in the downtown, but the ward cove port was fine so those ships could port (kinda glad to hear that and know NCL always uses ward cove). Some a day or two after our Skagway day couldn‚Äôt go to Skagway and had to skip it and stay overnight in Juneau! Overall, I‚Äôm so glad we had such good weather and didn‚Äôt miss out on anything! Even if I felt overdressed half the time (lol). 

But hearing the hit and miss with porting- I really don‚Äôt care about needing a shuttle bus as a person without a mobility issue. I‚Äôm very very pleased to see that the shuttle buses were free and largely did not require reservations. We had plenty of time in each port on this itinerary! And I really felt that Juneau was walking distance for us, so we actually skipped the shuttle. Victoria wasn‚Äôt bad walking distance so we also skipped the shuttle. And honestly, I was happy, we found an awesome art vender and found a lemonade stand on the walk back to the port. 

I‚Äôm still so excited at the way they did Glacier Bay! So happy to have had park rangers on board, and the park store (NP passport stamps too!!!), and that they opened the bow for viewing! I loved every single minute of the amazing scenery and really enjoyed the ranger presentation. 

We did an NCL associated excursion in every port and we had plenty of time to do the excursion and explore and eat/shop in town. Even to hike some local hiking trails for a bit too. And we still got back in time to eat the ship dinner and hit up the thermal spa. We chose excursions that got us further away from town so that we could see the area and also see the town. The only things I might have done differently was maybe a seaplane tour? (Honestly, still wouldn‚Äôt but hey) and maybe a hike on a glacier tour. But looking at them was nice too. 

The thermal spa was absolutely worth it and we were there every day at least once and for at least 1.5 hours each. We never had to fight for a thermal bed and I‚Äôm so so happy about the experience, the size, the sauna options, and the cleanliness. 

Also- the pillows in my stateroom were fantastic! We slept so much and honestly just found the bed and pillows so comfortable! | Are there any excursions in Skagway that go to Yukon? | Wow sounds like you got lucky with the weather. On a 7 day cruise, Sep 6-13, we had rain almost every day. | Thanks for posting. We're headed back to Alaska on the Joy in 2027. 

Quick question - can you add a little bit of detail about your whale watching trip? We're looking to do that, but several ports have those excursions and so we'll need to pick one. Any info would be appreciated.

Glad you had fun and great weather - ours was the same went we last went back in 2010. | Nice review. We have not been on this itinerary yet but seems like it might be one of the better ones. I see in the future it looks like there are not going to be as many 9-10 day and more 7 day Alaska itineraries on the Joy. | Thank you for posting this! I am going in September 2027. I have the club balcony suite with ‚Äúlarger‚Äù balcony. Were you comfortable in the room? I‚Äôve debated upgrading the room, but just hard to justify the extra money. It will just be my husband and myself. | I was on the same cruise, agree that we had the most amazing weather! Overall I thought it was a great cruise, my second with NCL. We ate mainly at buffet or MDR and thought the food was quite good. But we aren‚Äôt picky eaters or fancy types. Entertainment onboard was a little boring on sea days but not a big deal. I‚Äôm already looking into another cruise for 2026 or 2027. Thinking of New England and Canada. | Wasn't it awe-inspiring?? SO lucky with the weather. | So sorry about the Specialty Dining communication,  that sucks! 

That Glacier Bay Day was incredible.  Loved going to the bow, hanging out in the Observation Lounge, chilling on our balcony, enjoying the excellent staff everywhere. 

Wasn't it just the best cruise?? It was our 7th and we enjoyed it the most. Alaska is magical. The whining about the Ward Cove port is silly; it was a short line and an interesting ride into Ketchikan and it ended up being our favorite port day, wandering the city, eating delicious pizza at The Panhandle, knocking back beers at The Sourdough.

So happy you had a beautiful vacation too!! Alaska Forever ‚úåüèª | I appreciate this insight! My husband and I are going in September 2027 and honestly I probably would‚Äôve opted out of the dining experience is just for the sake of cost, but I am definitely going to look into booking them. I will look at our itinerary coordinate! | There were on my Alaska cruise on the Jade. 


I did the combo with the White Pass Railroad. At Fraser B.C., after passports were checked we disembarked the train and borded a bus for the Yukon. We stopped by the roadway sign for selfies, at a pristine lake for a few minutes and by a kinda cheesy ""Yukon experience"" place for lunch. The food wasn't bad though and their small museum gave a decent overview of things. Then on to Carcross where we had maybe 40 minutes to wander round the tiny town and its shops. (They have a very good tourist information office there and I picked up a bunch of brochures and magazines - going back on a road trip is now on my bucket list!)

They also had another excursion or two that went to the Yukon suspension bridge. | I did an excursion in Skagway that got close (you need your passport for it). We went to the Yukon Suspension bridge. We got to get off a couple of times for photos and of course saw the summit and everything. It was a breathtakingly beautiful drive‚Ä¶ and the tour guide was amazing | Yes the White Pass Railway crosses into Canada then bus to the Yukon! Remember the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Yukon is a ways away. | We were in Skagway for 9 hours I think? And it still wasn't quite enough time to go to the Yukon and back. Our excursion took us to Fraser, BC which was very remote and as close to the Yukon as we could get given the time. There might be helicopter trips? | Happy to! It was the undisputed highlight of our trip but, we did have absolutely perfect, gorgeous, cloudless, warm, sunny sunny sunny weather and our guides told us our day was as rare as seeing a full humpback breach, so we were incredibly appreciative and grateful for our luck. I had the cutest rain gear layers and outfit and didn't need any of it!

I originally booked the Whale Watching Quest + Mendenhall Glacier tour thru NCL. As I looked more into it, I decided I really didn't want to be on some huge boat with tons of pax jockeying for position. People on CruiseCritic suggested Harv and Marv's, even though apparently the namesakes sold their business many, many years ago but they were such legends that the name stuck. On my invoice I think it said Alaska Galore Tours. Only $169/pp which is far less expensive than booking thru the ship. They picked us up right outside our ship, dockside, in Juneau. Our bus driver was a local and sooooo damn entertaining up to the boat and back. Our particular boat was a 48-seater I think, but we only had 19 pax that day and we were blessed with very cool and fun boatmates! You get to know each other a bit during a 5+ hour excursion. We had an excellent captain and two naturalists that really knew their sh!t. Saw 6-7 humpback whales I would say, including a mother-calf pair! They took photos and at the end of the tour provided a link to their wonderful high-res images at no extra cost. Made it so we could truly enjoy the excursion and put our phones away. On the way back to the ship, our driver stopped at a scenic land lookout of the Mendenhall Glacier; would have loved to see it up a little closer and also hike Nugget Falls, but that's the tradeoff for more time on the water looking for whales, I suppose.

Couldn't recommend Harv & Marv's/Alaska Galore higher. What a day!!! Lmk if you have any other questions. | Oh boo. Love the Joy but would happily look at 9-day itineraries on other ships because, truly, the long hours in ports really made this trip for us. | On the Bliss we had friends in one of those rooms, are you on Deck 8 perhaps? We have sailed in Club Balcony Suite on 3 Breakaway+ ships now; it's not a suite and you get basically the same SF of a standard balcony. But!!! Gawd I love that bigger bathroom and that amazing shower with all the jets. Makes me feel like one of those fancy people to have such a great shower. Also I think the club balcony suites are in preferable locations? Our Deck 15 cabin right down the hall from Observation Lounge and one deck below the top deck with the Garden Cafe and the Waves and Surf bars? Wouldn't trade it for anything. You also get little teeny perks like sparkling wine, a bag of laundry to send out (Do This! It came back to us all folded and fresh and carefully laid out in a wicker basket, we were so impressed!) and two deliveries of canapes during your cruise. 

You could upgrade to a Suite I suppose and get a little more room? Or the Haven for all the amenities? We loved the location we booked so didn't want to risk losing that, we were perfectly comfortable just the two of us, and honestly we are just not Haven people. I think you'll be perfectly satisfied with your Club Balcony with that roomy balcony! | One of our bus drivers made a very good point to us about Ward Cove- they said over 500 locals lost their jobs when the factory closed and it was a huge upset to the locals and the economy. NCL buying and renovating it into a port apparently helped them and created jobs. Not to mention the port fees of the few extra ships certainly offer extra money to the local economy, schools, infrastructure, etc.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/pregnant) if you have any questions or concerns.* | If you brew the same amount of coffee grounds with more water, it will not dramatically increase the caffeine. It mainly makes the coffee weaker. At most you might get a little extra, maybe 5 to 15 mg, depending on how finely the coffee is ground and how long it brews. So with your four tablespoons brewed in twenty ounces of water, caffeine might be a little higher between 100 to 115 mg, but definitely not as high as 150 mg.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

I thought that since I‚Äôm going for the cheapest decent espresso machine and the cheapest flat burr grinder that the results will be mediocre. But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Buying anything with your package for someone else is against terms, and they can terminate your package (in theory, never seen it happen).  I‚Äôve seen plenty of times, if one is nice to the servers, they will be flexible. | Not sure but I thought both of you have to buy the package. | Your scenario has 3 problems.  [1] both ppl in stateroom must purchase the same pkg (standard, plus, premier).  [2] your Plus / Premier is supposed to be canceled if caught sharing it with a non-paying person. [3] can only order 1 drink at a time. | Outside of the fact that yes, usually all adults in a single cabin have to buy it, they otherwise do care. However enforcment is basically impossible. I have gone on plenty of cruises on various lines where I had a group in multiple cabins and got drinks for others, just be discreet about it. If they catch you they can cancel your package and refuse you further drinks with no refunds. | If you only want WiFi and won't drink much, probably best to just buy the stand alone WiFi for one device ($25/day).¬† You can switch devices using the same login.¬† BTW free drip coffee is mostly good, except late in the day in the buffet. At dinner in the MDR is fine.¬† Continental breakfast is free with hang tag. That can include a carafe of coffee. | Can I add on a question? If we have two people in the cabin, both with Plus, and we want to order a meal in, can one person order both meals or do we order separately? | Thanks! First time cruising. I didn't pick up on that when it was showing me options in the app. Appreciate it! | This is correct. And you amy not get drinks of any kind for someone without package or paying  

While OP feels its 'feasible ' its this kind of theft and dishonesty that is changing rhe packages. | These are all things I didn't know. I didn't get as far as the fine print in the app. Much appreciated! | Yes, this all makes a lot of sense. Didn't realize you both had to buy the package (this is my first cruise).

155,calories in oat milk latte,breastfeeding,I‚Äôm worried my milk is too watery and that‚Äôs why my baby is asking to be fed so much,Hi everyone I have a 2 month old baby that was born at 11lbs. My milk started off creamy the first 2 weeks and then changed into super watered down milk. The reason I think baby isn‚Äôt getting enough calories is because he is asking to bed fed every 2 hours and I‚Äôm giving him 5-5.5oz of milk in a bottle. If I do less he asks for food again in one hour. He is drinking almost 40oz!! I make around 50-55oz a day. He weighs 15lbs and is super long like 99 percentile. I don‚Äôt have fat plugs in my milk....,1,1758607350,"It's normal for baby to be eating really, really frequently. The idea that they should go longer between feeds was apparently based on a study of rabbits, not humans! 

Are you paced feeding? Baby's taking in a lot. | You have a big baby. It sounds like you're able to keep up with his big appetite. Good for you, seriously!


Pretty sure my baby nursed more than every 2 hours at 2 months (though I don't imagine he was getting anywhere near 40 oz! But I also have no idea) - that frequency is well within normal bounds. I don't think there's any problem here except that you'd rather have a different schedule - but at 2 months it's healthier to let baby set the feeding schedule if possible.¬† | My girl is 5 months and she still eats every 2 hours this is normal, they‚Äôre growing a lot!! | My baby is 91st centile and has always eaten every 1.5-2 hours rarely goes 3h. She is nearly 7m! | At two months its very, very normal for babies to feed that frequently and it isn't a sign theyre being underfed.  Neither is milk that looks more watery.  All milk is around 90+% water and in warmer months that increases to make sure that your baby is well hydrated.  Fat plugs are more or less a social media creation to make you feel like you need to buy some kind of lactation supplement or a special pump, and theyre not indicative that your baby isn't having their nutritional needs met.

All you need to worry about is this:

- is baby gaining weight/staying on the same growth centile?
- is baby making plenty of wet and dirty nappies?
- does baby seem generally well in themselves?

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Otherwise any non-espresso focused flat burr with good alignment mechanism like 064s, Philos, etc or the Lagom Casa. 064s and Philos you can upgrade with SSP MP and other burr sets if that‚Äôs something you wanna play with. 

Though if the plan is to do many back to back drinks frequently, the Casa, 064s and some of the others may struggle to do many back to back drinks. If that‚Äôs the case consider Philos / Eureka Atom

DF54 probably does well too but no comment on switching back and forth, that‚Äôs an issue with many grinders.

As for machine, bambino plus will do well if you don‚Äôt want to nerd out, or the GCP with eventual PID / Dimmer / gagguino if you want it to last long and allow you to nerd out.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

The regulations regarding dairy pasturiztion are rightfully very strict and the equipment prohibitively expensive. 

Low sugar sorbet just substitute allulose for sugar 1.3:1

What kind of machine are you using to spin your product? | Thanks for sharing that, it‚Äôs really helpful to hear from someone actually running a shop. In my case it‚Äôs frozen Greek yogurt soft serve and I‚Äôll be using a Carpigiani machine. I get what you‚Äôre saying about bases and that makes sense. What I‚Äôm still trying to figure out is the best way to add variety on top of a base without overcomplicating operations. Have you found a good system for introducing new flavors or keeping things interesting for customers while still keeping it consistent behind the counter? | I have 30 different flavors, including 4 vegan. We've been open for 4 years, and I make new stuff all the time. I own it so I can do whatever I want flavor wise. 

My background is culinary. I plan out my month with flavors that are seasonal and holiday specific. I engage with all my customers and get their opinions. I take requests. I go to other ice cream shops and see what they're making. I look at what's popular in the grocery store, too.

Edit It's all hard scoop ice cream | Thanks for explaining that, it‚Äôs really helpful. Since you‚Äôre using a base, do you mostly just add flavors on top of it or do you ever tweak the base itself? I‚Äôm trying to figure out how much flexibility there usually is when you‚Äôre running a shop | I dont know what you mean flavors on top. 

I make 30 unique different flavors of ice cream. I use extracts and coloring from Green Mountain Flavors. They use plant based colors and extracts. Everything from vanilla, black licorice, pistachio, creme brulee, rocky road, butter pecan, etc...

We have available sauces: hot fudge, white chocolate, chocolate, caramel, marshmallow, dulce de leche, nutella; toppings: walnuts, peanuts, almonds, reese's peanut butter cups, sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles, chocolate chip, gummy bears & worms (the kids love these), m&ms, skittles, whipped cream, cherries, pineapple, strawberries, and wet nuts. We used to have a lot more, but I narrowed it down to what we sold the most of. 

We make waffle bowls and cones in-house.

I honestly wish their rolls came in 4-6 pieces vs 6-10. I myself get full really fast but have the conundrum of wanting to try everything also lol | That's cool we can disagree.

When I lived with my parents a few years ago they had a sage/breville machine that I got used to operating, and I quite enjoyed being able to make my own lattes/flat whites at the weekend that tasted good and was a fraction of the price of what it'd be in a coffee shop.

Have bought my first home, and looking to ...",1,1758614247,"If you want to keep it simple, I‚Äôd suggest focusing the grinder on espresso -> K6 is great and that way you open up good no fuss options like GBW with the Mignon Libra.

Otherwise any non-espresso focused flat burr with good alignment mechanism like 064s, Philos, etc or the Lagom Casa. 064s and Philos you can upgrade with SSP MP and other burr sets if that‚Äôs something you wanna play with. 

Though if the plan is to do many back to back drinks frequently, the Casa, 064s and some of the others may struggle to do many back to back drinks. If that‚Äôs the case consider Philos / Eureka Atom

DF54 probably does well too but no comment on switching back and forth, that‚Äôs an issue with many grinders.

As for machine, bambino plus will do well if you don‚Äôt want to nerd out, or the GCP with eventual PID / Dimmer / gagguino if you want it to last long and allow you to nerd out.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

I thought that since I‚Äôm going for the cheapest decent espresso machine and the cheapest flat burr grinder that the results will be mediocre. But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Buying anything with your package for someone else is against terms, and they can terminate your package (in theory, never seen it happen).  I‚Äôve seen plenty of times, if one is nice to the servers, they will be flexible. | Not sure but I thought both of you have to buy the package. | Your scenario has 3 problems.  [1] both ppl in stateroom must purchase the same pkg (standard, plus, premier).  [2] your Plus / Premier is supposed to be canceled if caught sharing it with a non-paying person. [3] can only order 1 drink at a time. | Outside of the fact that yes, usually all adults in a single cabin have to buy it, they otherwise do care. However enforcment is basically impossible. I have gone on plenty of cruises on various lines where I had a group in multiple cabins and got drinks for others, just be discreet about it. If they catch you they can cancel your package and refuse you further drinks with no refunds. | If you only want WiFi and won't drink much, probably best to just buy the stand alone WiFi for one device ($25/day).¬† You can switch devices using the same login.¬† BTW free drip coffee is mostly good, except late in the day in the buffet. At dinner in the MDR is fine.¬† Continental breakfast is free with hang tag. That can include a carafe of coffee. | Can I add on a question? If we have two people in the cabin, both with Plus, and we want to order a meal in, can one person order both meals or do we order separately? | Thanks! First time cruising. I didn't pick up on that when it was showing me options in the app. Appreciate it! | This is correct. And you amy not get drinks of any kind for someone without package or paying  

While OP feels its 'feasible ' its this kind of theft and dishonesty that is changing rhe packages. | These are all things I didn't know. I didn't get as far as the fine print in the app. Much appreciated! | Yes, this all makes a lot of sense. Didn't realize you both had to buy the package (this is my first cruise).

Otherwise any non-espresso focused flat burr with good alignment mechanism like 064s, Philos, etc or the Lagom Casa. 064s and Philos you can upgrade with SSP MP and other burr sets if that‚Äôs something you wanna play with. 

Though if the plan is to do many back to back drinks frequently, the Casa, 064s and some of the others may struggle to do many back to back drinks. If that‚Äôs the case consider Philos / Eureka Atom

DF54 probably does well too but no comment on switching back and forth, that‚Äôs an issue with many grinders.

245,akasa specialty coffee,gaggiaclassic,Finally got my Gaggia classic and it‚Äôs better than I expected,"So I finally decided to add an espresso machine to my brewing gadgets. I thought that since I‚Äôm going for the cheapest decent espresso machine and the cheapest flat burr grinder that the results will be mediocre. But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Edit: Question answered. Both people must get a package, sharing not allowed! Understood! Appreciate the quick responses. ",4,1758598558,"If your wife is in the same cabin, she'll need to buy plus too. | If you buy plus, your cabin mate has to buy it too, and pretty much for this reason.  

Buying anything with your package for someone else is against terms, and they can terminate your package (in theory, never seen it happen).  I‚Äôve seen plenty of times, if one is nice to the servers, they will be flexible. | Not sure but I thought both of you have to buy the package. | Your scenario has 3 problems.  [1] both ppl in stateroom must purchase the same pkg (standard, plus, premier).  [2] your Plus / Premier is supposed to be canceled if caught sharing it with a non-paying person. [3] can only order 1 drink at a time. | Outside of the fact that yes, usually all adults in a single cabin have to buy it, they otherwise do care. However enforcment is basically impossible. I have gone on plenty of cruises on various lines where I had a group in multiple cabins and got drinks for others, just be discreet about it. If they catch you they can cancel your package and refuse you further drinks with no refunds. | If you only want WiFi and won't drink much, probably best to just buy the stand alone WiFi for one device ($25/day).¬† You can switch devices using the same login.¬† BTW free drip coffee is mostly good, except late in the day in the buffet. At dinner in the MDR is fine.¬† Continental breakfast is free with hang tag. That can include a carafe of coffee. | Can I add on a question? If we have two people in the cabin, both with Plus, and we want to order a meal in, can one person order both meals or do we order separately? | Thanks! First time cruising. I didn't pick up on that when it was showing me options in the app. Appreciate it! | This is correct. And you amy not get drinks of any kind for someone without package or paying  

While OP feels its 'feasible ' its this kind of theft and dishonesty that is changing rhe packages. | These are all things I didn't know. I didn't get as far as the fine print in the app. Much appreciated! | Yes, this all makes a lot of sense. Didn't realize you both had to buy the package (this is my first cruise).

288,calories in oat milk,breastfeeding,I‚Äôm worried my milk is too watery and that‚Äôs why my baby is asking to be fed so much,Hi everyone I have a 2 month old baby that was born at 11lbs. My milk started off creamy the first 2 weeks and then changed into super watered down milk. The reason I think baby isn‚Äôt getting enough calories is because he is asking to bed fed every 2 hours and I‚Äôm giving him 5-5.5oz of milk in a bottle. If I do less he asks for food again in one hour. He is drinking almost 40oz!! I make around 50-55oz a day. He weighs 15lbs and is super long like 99 percentile. I don‚Äôt have fat plugs in my milk....,1,1758607350,"It's normal for baby to be eating really, really frequently. The idea that they should go longer between feeds was apparently based on a study of rabbits, not humans! 

Are you paced feeding? Baby's taking in a lot. | You have a big baby. It sounds like you're able to keep up with his big appetite. Good for you, seriously!


Pretty sure my baby nursed more than every 2 hours at 2 months (though I don't imagine he was getting anywhere near 40 oz! But I also have no idea) - that frequency is well within normal bounds. I don't think there's any problem here except that you'd rather have a different schedule - but at 2 months it's healthier to let baby set the feeding schedule if possible.¬† | My girl is 5 months and she still eats every 2 hours this is normal, they‚Äôre growing a lot!! | My baby is 91st centile and has always eaten every 1.5-2 hours rarely goes 3h. She is nearly 7m! | At two months its very, very normal for babies to feed that frequently and it isn't a sign theyre being underfed.  Neither is milk that looks more watery.  All milk is around 90+% water and in warmer months that increases to make sure that your baby is well hydrated.  Fat plugs are more or less a social media creation to make you feel like you need to buy some kind of lactation supplement or a special pump, and theyre not indicative that your baby isn't having their nutritional needs met.

All you need to worry about is this:

- is baby gaining weight/staying on the same growth centile?
- is baby making plenty of wet and dirty nappies?
- does baby seem generally well in themselves?

If the answer to all 3 is yes, then chances are everything is pretty much fine.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

What should i do i don't w...",1,1758600924,"‚ÄúI have been eating in surplus‚Äù

dont | Your problem is two-fold:

1. You‚Äôre eating at a surplus. Do remember that the belly is the first place you put fat on when gaining weight and the last place you shed fat from when losing weight. You NEED to eat at a deficit.

2. Your diet doesn‚Äôt have enough protein while being extremely high in simple carbs (oats, rotis, rice). These simple carbs are going to keep your insulin up, making it very difficult to shed weight in the long run. There‚Äôs no reason to have 5 rotis AND rice. Replace some of that with something rich in protein, like meat. 

Eating more and more protein while on a deficit will keep your muscles intact while losing fat. | 5 rotis in one sitting? Seems too much. Also that milkshake is a calorie bomb. Any reason why you need so many calories? | If you keep eating and do not do portion control then how do you expect to lose anything? | Means you are eating too much.  
  
50 gram oats 700 ml milk 2 tablespoon peanut butter 1.5 scoop whey 1 banana  
This doesn't seem like a diet where you wanna loose fat and gain muscle at the same time.  
 Just have whey with water and with oats maybe. Remove Peanut butter and banana. Track the calories properly and manage your intake according to that | If you wanna maintain muscle in a cut/deficit you'd need atleast 1.6g/kg and upto 2g/kg of protein while also being on a decent deficit. | Bro i lose muscle then like i am not big by any standards in deficit i look skinny as hell | What is alternative for rice? I forgot to mention i eat 9 or 10 egg whites too | You don't loose muscle if you're getting stronger.

Have some patience, eat at maintenance for a year straight and then do a cut. 

Itna impatient rahoge toh cut bulk cut bulk hi karte rahoge | Its called a cut. Maintain protein intake and do a slight -200/300 caloric deficit. | Why do you eat just egg whites? You're throwing away half the protein and a ton of healthy fats by not eating the yolks.

>What is alternative for rice?

Maybe just reduce the quantity? Or sub it for more vegetables and meat? | Idk i read somewhere it's not good for health | It is very good for health; a whole egg is among the most nutritious things you can eat.

I explained how low my self esteem is over him and he makes me feel worthless and his response was just he will look at what he wants. He doesn‚Äôt care he doesn‚Äôt care how I feel he doesn‚Äôt care I cry myself to sleep most nights he just doesn‚Äôt care about my feelings so why why why do I still love this man so much, why can‚Äôt I just accept he doesn‚Äôt care. Leaving is not an option right now we have 2 babies and rely on him financially. Even
If I could leave him would I be able to. He does nothing for me and I do so much for him I‚Äôm
So mentally drained from it, I look after myself and make an effort daily so I look presentable and it does unnoticed I wish I could just concentrate on my own life and not worry about his opinion of me

Otherwise any non-espresso focused flat burr with good alignment mechanism like 064s, Philos, etc or the Lagom Casa. 064s and Philos you can upgrade with SSP MP and other burr sets if that‚Äôs something you wanna play with. 

Though if the plan is to do many back to back drinks frequently, the Casa, 064s and some of the others may struggle to do many back to back drinks. If that‚Äôs the case consider Philos / Eureka Atom

DF54 probably does well too but no comment on switching back and forth, that‚Äôs an issue with many grinders.

326,specialty coffee singapore,gaggiaclassic,Finally got my Gaggia classic and it‚Äôs better than I expected,"So I finally decided to add an espresso machine to my brewing gadgets. I thought that since I‚Äôm going for the cheapest decent espresso machine and the cheapest flat burr grinder that the results will be mediocre. But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",20,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

To clarify, I have no formal anxiety diagnosis at the moment - I suspect I have had one from before (tried to get diagnosed but honestly was putting off booking the appointment) and I am currently in the process of getting diagnosed.

On Saturday, I took a 200mg caffeine pill at around 7pm, and another one at around 9:20pm ish.

That spiked my heart rate quite a lot as you can imagine, though this is not an unusual dosage for me. I wouldn't always do that amount but sometimes I did, and...",4,1758568632,"Mostly sound like anxiety /  panic side effects to me.  Especially derealization. | This is the most prototypical ‚ÄúI have anxiety‚Äù post ever. This is JUST anxiety!! I know it‚Äôs hard to conceive of that in your acute state, but down the line when your nervous system regulates, you‚Äôll look back on this and giggle. 

During heightened anxiety is ill-advised to have any caffeine intake so you‚Äôve done a lot by just ceasing its use. For gods sake do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt look up symptoms and other people‚Äôs account of theirs. That‚Äôs a sure way to make yourself worse. Make a commitment to defer to your medical team with no Reddit side quests. | It was all caused by the 400mg of caffeine I had on September 13th - I understand probably most of the symptoms are stemming from the anxiety, but I never had anxiety at this level until that incident.

I'm super scared I permanently fucked up my body - any reassurance or information anyone has would be greatly appreciated. | Good to keep in mind - though odd I haven't ever had problems like this to this degree before. Ideas on how to regulate? | I think you may just be in a . Very anxious/panic stricken loop.  I‚Äôve had similar times in my life where I‚Äôve felt similarly and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve caused any actually damage due to the caffeine intake | Time spent with people could help. Being present with others can distract your mind. And then the obvious ones like exercise | How do I fix this? | Go to the appointment with the mental health professional. | You're experiencing a severe anxiety response which, over time, will almost certainly fix itself. The important thing is not to add fuel to the fire by catastrophizing about the symptoms. Let the symptoms settle down. They're not dangerous in themselves. You haven't done any permanent damage. Try not to add more fear and anxiety to the anxiety you're already experiencing. | >The important thing is not to add fuel to the fire by catastrophizing about the symptoms.

How do I even do this üò≠ everything right now is being filtered through this lens - sleep, work, friends, general existence. I feel discomfort just watching shows and playing games because of these symptoms. | Accept that this is anxiety and nothing more. In other words, you're dealing with a bunch of disturbing and overwhelming feelings and sensations. But these feelings and sensations are not dangerous or harmful. They're exactly what anxiety is meant to do. So that even though the symptoms are terrible, they are normal in an anxiety state, and you don't have to be afraid of them.


What this means is that when you're experiencing these symptoms, file them under anxiety and just let them be. Worrying about them and fighting them reinforces the idea that they are dangerous. This amplifies the anxiety and puts you in a feedback loop.¬†


I realise this is far easier to say than do, because it means taking a different perspective on your symptoms - no longer treating them as dangerous. You're distressed and frightened, so your natural reaction is to resist the symptoms and try to get rid of them. But it's the resistance which keeps them going because it creates more agitation and anxiety. Don't fight, don't resist, let the symptoms come and go.


There is no reason to believe that you will live in a ""permanent state of anxiety"". You overdosed on caffeine and your body experienced a kind of shock. This won't be a permanent response. How long it lasts is partly determined by beliefs about anxiety and attitudes towards it. The trick anxiety plays is that it makes you feel so bad that you jump to the conclusion that things must be REALLY bad. But this is not at all the case.

I hope this helps a bit. I've been where you are and I fully understand how scary and overwhelming it feels. But the danger is not real, however real it feels. | https://itsonlyanxiety.com/¬†

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

I thought that since I‚Äôm going for the cheapest decent espresso machine and the cheapest flat burr grinder that the results will be mediocre. But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Buying anything with your package for someone else is against terms, and they can terminate your package (in theory, never seen it happen).  I‚Äôve seen plenty of times, if one is nice to the servers, they will be flexible. | Not sure but I thought both of you have to buy the package. | Your scenario has 3 problems.

[3] can only order 1 drink at a time. | Outside of the fact that yes, usually all adults in a single cabin have to buy it, they otherwise do care. However enforcment is basically impossible. I have gone on plenty of cruises on various lines where I had a group in multiple cabins and got drinks for others, just be discreet about it. If they catch you they can cancel your package and refuse you further drinks with no refunds. | If you only want WiFi and won't drink much, probably best to just buy the stand alone WiFi for one device ($25/day).¬† You can switch devices using the same login.¬† BTW free drip coffee is mostly good, except late in the day in the buffet. At dinner in the MDR is fine.¬† Continental breakfast is free with hang tag. That can include a carafe of coffee. | Can I add on a question? If we have two people in the cabin, both with Plus, and we want to order a meal in, can one person order both meals or do we order separately? | Thanks! First time cruising. I didn't pick up on that when it was showing me options in the app. Appreciate it! | This is correct. And you amy not get drinks of any kind for someone without package or paying  

While OP feels its 'feasible ' its this kind of theft and dishonesty that is changing rhe packages. | These are all things I didn't know. I didn't get as far as the fine print in the app. Much appreciated! | Yes, this all makes a lot of sense. Didn't realize you both had to buy the package (this is my first cruise).

There are plenty of organisations and industries who work 7 day weeks, that could be a normal working day for the hiring manager.

Sunday may be your day off from thinking about work, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you are uncontactable as an applicant.  Many don‚Äôt get back to people at all, so I‚Äôd be grateful they took the time to let you know. | Eh, I think you're overreacting, it's a LinkedIn message, not an all weekend crunch session.

Could have been:

* ""oh crap, I forgot to message that guy, better fix that""
* Friday afternoon laziness, ""I'll send it over the weekend and go to the pub now"" 
* The final decision only got made after the hiring manager went home for the weekend, and they were being diligent to not let you down
* They haven't left work since Tuesday and their family are looking for them, posters with a picture and ""have you seen our dad?"" are up all round town

Realistically, they did 10 minutes work, it could be bad culture, it could be them being dilligent and keeping promises (end of week) even though it's a no, it could just be them flexing commitments around other stuff.

So many posibilities, 10 minutes mild effort to give you a response, and not leave you hanging, is hardly evidence that they're running a sweatshop.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

A lot of what you‚Äôre saying are more so excuses/ choices than actual hindrances. (Tough love, sorry)

You need to give yourself some rules that are non negotiable or you will continue to stress and forget everything and be in a crap mood before the day even starts.

Meal prep is on Sunday and Wednesday. Make two different meals. Block off a 2 hour window for these two things so your lunches and dinners are done and ready to be grabbed out of the fridge in the mornings. 

Prepackage snacks, and refill your water bottle every night before you go to bed, put these things in your bag with your laptop and whatever else you need.  

Put a 20 in the back of your phone case for emergencies for food.

If you start at 8 am, you must aim to be at class or work for 7:30. If you take public transit, have the routes on your phone ready so you can watch where the bus is.

No social media in the morning until you get on your public transit.

Outfits and jewelry, you have your favourites that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre more than likely going to wear put them out the night before and if you REALLY want to change something it‚Äôs one piece, not the entire outfit. You‚Äôll look just as good if it‚Äôs pre planned, I promise. Probably even better, since you had time to think about it and not rushing around.

Make up if you forget or run out of time, tinted sunscreen, brow gel, mascara, lip oil: keep it in your bag. You‚Äôre young, I promise you look great with minimal, all of us 30 year olds are jealous. 

Put an alarm clock at the furthest piece of furniture or even on the floor from your bed so you have to get up to turn it off. Buy one of the really old school very ugly faux wood with the red numbering alarm clocks, those babies worked every single day for 40 years, they never, ever break. You set it once and it will go off every day at the same time.

And listen, I know these work flawlessly. Do I do them every week? No because that‚Äôs life. But if you get some of it right, it makes it a little easier. That‚Äôs the goal is to get a little better every day. | I have my kettle full, and I grind my pour over  coffee and weigh it out the night before. Simply gets me going the right way :-) | To minimize ""morning of"" decision making, can you rearrange some of these decisions to the night before instead? Clothing and accessories, bag/backpack/purse all laid out ready for you when you wake up? 

Before I started working from home, I also moved all my makeup & even tootbrush/toothpaste or Wisps into a ""go bag"" for the really late days and would do those tasks on my commute or in a bathroom at work.

Showering at night, having a wash and go haircut etc. also helped me too. | https://preview.redd.it/39h4ys557kqf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d52cafd1ac0a88e724f8e7e556322929d5a37b44 | Get things ready in advance | I do all those on Sunday for the week and if that was my schedule I‚Äôd do cold brew for the week in the fridge. Evenings are for whatever else has to get done so Friday and Saturday are relaxing time with no ‚Äúchores‚Äú. Mornings I wake up with multiple alarms, listen to podcasts, and take like an hour to get ready and out the door - everything was prepped Sunday so I just have to get up and start doing the things. | You will have to prioritize if this is actually really important or even life-affecting.  You don't ""need"" to do all that, you need to get out of bed and get out the door in as few steps as possible, without phones, and you need to walk out the door at a specific time every day - NON! NEGOTIABLE! so you should keep an emergency outfit by the door or you're going out naked - so that you arrive at your destination (given average travel times) 30 minutes early unless there is trouble in transit.  You can use that 30 minutes, once you are right at the door, to play - do makeup, get on the phone, whatever.

That's it, that's how you do it.  All those ""needs"" are privileges you should give up to start and maybe you can earn some of them back, but for me I have to work to stay alive and off the streets. So I do not wear high-maintenance hair, I use a ""uniform"" wardrobe, I pack lunch and breakfast the night before if not the weekend before and I get a Diet Coke to fuel me until I get to a place where I can have a leisurely coffee.  Getting to do what one ""likes"" is for people who get to work/school on time, and that's not me, so I have to do what actually works.  

I get my playtime when I arrive early, and I indulge my other fun desires after work when it can't make me late. | All of that. And especially this: ""You need to give yourself some rules that are non negotiable or you will continue to stress and forget everything and be in a crap mood before the day even starts."" | So you use a simple coffee maker with a filter?

466,oat milk latte calories,breastfeeding,I‚Äôm worried my milk is too watery and that‚Äôs why my baby is asking to be fed so much,Hi everyone I have a 2 month old baby that was born at 11lbs. My milk started off creamy the first 2 weeks and then changed into super watered down milk. The reason I think baby isn‚Äôt getting enough calories is because he is asking to bed fed every 2 hours and I‚Äôm giving him 5-5.5oz of milk in a bottle. If I do less he asks for food again in one hour. He is drinking almost 40oz!! I make around 50-55oz a day. He weighs 15lbs and is super long like 99 percentile. I don‚Äôt have fat plugs in my milk....,1,1758607350,"It's normal for baby to be eating really, really frequently.

Are you paced feeding? Baby's taking in a lot. | You have a big baby. It sounds like you're able to keep up with his big appetite. Good for you, seriously!


Pretty sure my baby nursed more than every 2 hours at 2 months (though I don't imagine he was getting anywhere near 40 oz! But I also have no idea) - that frequency is well within normal bounds. I don't think there's any problem here except that you'd rather have a different schedule - but at 2 months it's healthier to let baby set the feeding schedule if possible.¬† | My girl is 5 months and she still eats every 2 hours this is normal, they‚Äôre growing a lot!! | My baby is 91st centile and has always eaten every 1.5-2 hours rarely goes 3h. She is nearly 7m! | At two months its very, very normal for babies to feed that frequently and it isn't a sign theyre being underfed.  Neither is milk that looks more watery.  All milk is around 90+% water and in warmer months that increases to make sure that your baby is well hydrated.  Fat plugs are more or less a social media creation to make you feel like you need to buy some kind of lactation supplement or a special pump, and theyre not indicative that your baby isn't having their nutritional needs met.

All you need to worry about is this:

- is baby gaining weight/staying on the same growth centile?
- is baby making plenty of wet and dirty nappies?
- does baby seem generally well in themselves?

If the answer to all 3 is yes, then chances are everything is pretty much fine.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

A lot of what you‚Äôre saying are more so excuses/ choices than actual hindrances. (Tough love, sorry)

You need to give yourself some rules that are non negotiable or you will continue to stress and forget everything and be in a crap mood before the day even starts.

Meal prep is on Sunday and Wednesday. Make two different meals. Block off a 2 hour window for these two things so your lunches and dinners are done and ready to be grabbed out of the fridge in the mornings. 

Prepackage snacks, and refill your water bottle every night before you go to bed, put these things in your bag with your laptop and whatever else you need.  

Put a 20 in the back of your phone case for emergencies for food.

If you start at 8 am, you must aim to be at class or work for 7:30. If you take public transit, have the routes on your phone ready so you can watch where the bus is.

No social media in the morning until you get on your public transit.

Outfits and jewelry, you have your favourites that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre more than likely going to wear put them out the night before and if you REALLY want to change something it‚Äôs one piece, not the entire outfit. You‚Äôll look just as good if it‚Äôs pre planned, I promise. Probably even better, since you had time to think about it and not rushing around.

Make up if you forget or run out of time, tinted sunscreen, brow gel, mascara, lip oil: keep it in your bag. You‚Äôre young, I promise you look great with minimal, all of us 30 year olds are jealous. 

Put an alarm clock at the furthest piece of furniture or even on the floor from your bed so you have to get up to turn it off. Buy one of the really old school very ugly faux wood with the red numbering alarm clocks, those babies worked every single day for 40 years, they never, ever break. You set it once and it will go off every day at the same time.

And listen, I know these work flawlessly. Do I do them every week? No because that‚Äôs life. But if you get some of it right, it makes it a little easier. That‚Äôs the goal is to get a little better every day. | I have my kettle full, and I grind my pour over  coffee and weigh it out the night before. Simply gets me going the right way :-) | To minimize ""morning of"" decision making, can you rearrange some of these decisions to the night before instead? Clothing and accessories, bag/backpack/purse all laid out ready for you when you wake up? 

Before I started working from home, I also moved all my makeup & even tootbrush/toothpaste or Wisps into a ""go bag"" for the really late days and would do those tasks on my commute or in a bathroom at work.

Showering at night, having a wash and go haircut etc. also helped me too. | https://preview.redd.it/39h4ys557kqf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d52cafd1ac0a88e724f8e7e556322929d5a37b44 | Get things ready in advance | I do all those on Sunday for the week and if that was my schedule I‚Äôd do cold brew for the week in the fridge. Evenings are for whatever else has to get done so Friday and Saturday are relaxing time with no ‚Äúchores‚Äú. Mornings I wake up with multiple alarms, listen to podcasts, and take like an hour to get ready and out the door - everything was prepped Sunday so I just have to get up and start doing the things. | You will have to prioritize if this is actually really important or even life-affecting.  You don't ""need"" to do all that, you need to get out of bed and get out the door in as few steps as possible, without phones, and you need to walk out the door at a specific time every day - NON! NEGOTIABLE! so you should keep an emergency outfit by the door or you're going out naked - so that you arrive at your destination (given average travel times) 30 minutes early unless there is trouble in transit.  You can use that 30 minutes, once you are right at the door, to play - do makeup, get on the phone, whatever.

That's it, that's how you do it.  All those ""needs"" are privileges you should give up to start and maybe you can earn some of them back, but for me I have to work to stay alive and off the streets. So I do not wear high-maintenance hair, I use a ""uniform"" wardrobe, I pack lunch and breakfast the night before if not the weekend before and I get a Diet Coke to fuel me until I get to a place where I can have a leisurely coffee.  Getting to do what one ""likes"" is for people who get to work/school on time, and that's not me, so I have to do what actually works.  

I get my playtime when I arrive early, and I indulge my other fun desires after work when it can't make me late. | All of that. And especially this: ""You need to give yourself some rules that are non negotiable or you will continue to stress and forget everything and be in a crap mood before the day even starts."" | So you use a simple coffee maker with a filter?

538,instant espresso,espresso,it's amazing what difference a grinder can make,"I recently bought a df54 as an upgrade from my kingrinder K6 (nothing wrong with it, but grinding manually can be annoying).

I choose the df54 since it was within my budget and reviews looked very good, including videos about it, including conparisations to grinders on a similar price point.

and oh my god. even with the same machine, beans, water and puck prep after figuring out the right setting there is such an big difference. the espresso is cleaner, sweeter and tasted generally much better...",63,1758518634,"The ""grind profile"" is the chart of particle size vs percentage (or weight) - as no grinder creates grinds all of exactly the same size. Some grinders give a profile with a narrow band of particle size. This leads to a high clarity taste (good for light roasts with complicated tasting notes). Some grinders give a profile with a wide band of particle size, or a greater percentage of the really tiny particles (called ""fines"") which muddies the clarity but thickens the texture or ""body"" of the shot. Clarity and Body seem to be polar opposite results when grinding. ""Better"" grinders are supposed to offer better Clarity while maintaining Body, but there be the chase. I \*think\* better grinders produce fewer fines but I'm only guessing; I don't know.

I suppose you've discovered a grinder where the amount of fines produced or the width of the profile is more to your liking than the K6. | I had the same experience moving from a K6 to a Casa 65CL.

I think one grossly overlooked factor in hand grinding is feed and RPM consistency, which can alter your particle distribution and lead to inconsistent shots. Plus the workflow for hand grinding spro just sucks imo. | I just had this realization last week. We had a bs grinder and just made the move to the DF54. Even the drinks while dialing in the new DF54 were so much better than what we were drinking before.¬† | I went from a magic bullet and a Moka pot to a df54 with a bambino and felt like I was drinking coffee for the first time... I love the df54, but now I'm curious if the more expensive ones will give me any measurable improvement over it | It's the difference in these overall grinders, the burr shape is just one of many factors. For example, the difference between the K6 vs K4, which are both manual, conical burrs (of the same size), was that the specific burr geometry of the K4 produced more fines, which led to the typical Italian style shot. The K6 leads to more clarity, which usually brings with it acidity for most beans.

So, you can't tell this just from ""conical vs flat"", or other individual features. A grinder really is the sum of its parts: motor, burr size, burr shape, burr geometry, RPM's, adjustment mechanism, etc.

You really gotta do taste tests to see what flavors a grinder brings out. If you like the sweet flavor profile in your espresso, don't just ask, ""what is a good grinder?"" Ask, ""Which grinder is good to make sweeter shots?"" | I literally just bought the K6 and plan on buying a df54 at some point, I chose the k6 because I thought for now a good hand grinder will be fine Hahaha. I‚Äôm interested to see what others think aswell. | What I noticed right away going from the built in grinder on the barista express to an 064s was the aroma of the grind. It so much heavier in the air. There is for sure some science on those wee bean smashers | Glad to hear you like it. I ordered a DF54 yesterday (should be with me tomorrow) and I can't wait to get my hands on it. | I first bought a Comandante C40; then I wanted and ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù a bought a Eureka SD; after a while I realized the Comandante was way better.

If the budget is bellow several thousand Euro, I will always recommend a Comandante. | Going from a K6 to a DF54 made me realize I actually like light roasts more than dark! I also use the catch cup from the K6 with my DF54 now, as it fits better with my 54mm portafilter. 
I always tell myself I'm holding on to my K6 to use for dark roasts (I think I prefer dark roasts on conical burrs) or for travelling but it rarely leaves the cupboard now haha | Where are you guys buying your d54s? Any recommendations on reputable sellers? | I find flat burrs superior in every regard - even with really dark roasts they get more complex aromas out of the coffee that any conical can (I tested a crazy amount of different ones). And even stepping up from the DF54 to tue df64 is big and then to the DF83v was huge too‚Ä¶ but the the big conical burrs I tried (I went up all the way to 83mm) was always disappointing for me in comparison with flat burrs (I mainly try dark to very dark roasts and even then the flat burrs tasted a lot better in the cup) | This is going to be my exact upgrade path within the next few months. I have a K6 and I‚Äôve been eyeing a DF54 for a bit. | The grinder can and will be the difference between every fresh bean you buy testing the exact same mediocre liquid or being extremely different in terms of tastes and notes.

I have first hand experience on this. Used to have $500 Delonghi with a built in grinder many years ago. I kid you not I had some beans with the profile taste of cinnamon, basically tasted no cinnamon at all. I was thinking that this is some sort of gimmick cause i knew nothing about espresso back then.

I am now using a df83v and if you drank the same beans from this grinder, i kid you not, there is zero chance you wouldn't think i've put cinnamon inside. Overwhelming cinnamon taste. 

It's crazy how much of a difference it makes. | K6 has more clarity and df54 has more body, maybe you are just tasting that. Maybe also the fact df54 burrs are still sharp and producing more fines than normal. | oooh good catch with the rpm consistency or rather lack there off lol | Only one way to find out! | That‚Äôs interesting - what‚Äôs the deal with the K6 leading to more acidity, and if I like manual grinders and want less acidity, what should I look for? | don't get me wrong, the K6 is great and I made some really good espresso with it, but there is, at least in my very short experience, a step up between them lol | I got mine from espressooutlet.com in the United States",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Yes.
Can they make consistently the same espresso everyday? No. 

To make an espresso you need some sort of a water heater, a pump to push water and a seal tight grouphead where water and coffee meet and extract.

541,instant espresso,espresso,Affordable espresso grinders? Is it even possible? [$100],"Hello! I've gotten into espresso making recently (hyperfixation lol) and desperately need a grinder. I'd like the preface this by saying that I am in the United States and I am a minor (I'm not allowed to spend money, even if its my own from working).

Alright, here's the situation: I got into espresso \~2 months ago. I've always loved coffee and partially got into espresso because it would prevent impromptu Starbucks visits filled with overpriced, mediocre coffee. Anyways, I got my espresso mac...",5,1758495780,"If you can spend $100, Kingrinder K6 is your best option. It will perform much better than those $200 electrics. Next best option would be K2. 

This video will help you decide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyXzk_Q7l8A The title says it's a P series review, but it also covers K. | Timemore c3 esp works for me and I got it under $90. | K6 | Ok the long game. Go for the $100 grinder like Capresso, which will get you espresso grind. Use it and make your parents their favorite drinks until they are hooked. Then ask for the nice expensive grinder. | That price could get you a used Dose Control Pro, and likely a SmartGrinder Pro on Marketplace, but not sure your parental units will go for that.  The only real new option is a hand grinder.  I have no personal experience with hand grinders, but Lance just put out a video in which he explores the Kingrinder ""P"" series, and compares it with a number of other hand grinders.  The P3 can be had for about $50 USD.  There are slightly better options that approach $100 USD.


https://youtu.be/TyXzk_Q7l8A?si=2OtY-bYalBB0bK3O | If you're stuck with a $100 budget and are not allowed second hand or manual I would suggest first holding out for Black Friday, the Baratza you're looking at is now their old model - you could get lucky - and failing that there's an Oxo grinder that would be marginally better than your current options. I'd suggest a K6 though, not sure what your mother has against it, it's far better for her if she's not the one using it. Electric grinders are loud, hand grinders are not. | Kingrinder K4 or K6. Don't get the P series for espresso, they aren't really unpressurized capable. If it has to be cheaper, I wouldn't go under K2. | You will use your grinder for years, if you‚Äôre extracting coffee worth the effort, you‚Äôll spend more than that budget on 6 bags of coffee.ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è | Depends on where you are but Facebook marketplace can be a good option. I got a eureka silenzio for $100 on there. | So why can‚Äôt you spend your own money that you get from working? And why does your mom have an opinion on whether or not you use a hand grinder for your own hobby of making espresso? Your mom sounds a little nuts tbh‚Ä¶that sucks I‚Äôm sorry | Don't get a cheap electric grinder. The Kingrinder K6 everybody recommends is much better than any cheap electrical (and I'd say it's even better than some more expensive ones).

If you have an electric screwdriver or a small battery powered drill, you can use it to power the K6 if you really want electric. But the manual handle is very comfortable and easy to use. | Eureka Filtro and put espresso burrs in it. | What many have said. I guess it also depends if you are wanting dark or light roasts. If darker roasts, you have a bit more options (I believe the Timemore C2 or C3, or the Kingrinder K2 are more suitable for darker roasts. 

The K6 and the 1zepresso Q2 are more suitable for lighter roasts. I haven't tested them all out but that was what I gathered from Lance's video | Another vote for the K6. Works like a charm with my Bambino. | If you can somehow manage to budge to ~$160, the Shardor 64mm is a crazy good deal and is a gateway into upgradable 64mm flat burrs | Love my k6. Can't go wrong with it | I purchased this remanufactured one directly from Breville for $130:

555,oat milk calories,breastfeeding,I‚Äôm worried my milk is too watery and that‚Äôs why my baby is asking to be fed so much,Hi everyone I have a 2 month old baby that was born at 11lbs. My milk started off creamy the first 2 weeks and then changed into super watered down milk. The reason I think baby isn‚Äôt getting enough calories is because he is asking to bed fed every 2 hours and I‚Äôm giving him 5-5.5oz of milk in a bottle. If I do less he asks for food again in one hour. He is drinking almost 40oz!! I make around 50-55oz a day. He weighs 15lbs and is super long like 99 percentile. I don‚Äôt have fat plugs in my milk....,1,1758607350,"It's normal for baby to be eating really, really frequently. The idea that they should go longer between feeds was apparently based on a study of rabbits, not humans! 

Are you paced feeding? Baby's taking in a lot. | You have a big baby. It sounds like you're able to keep up with his big appetite. Good for you, seriously!


Pretty sure my baby nursed more than every 2 hours at 2 months (though I don't imagine he was getting anywhere near 40 oz! But I also have no idea) - that frequency is well within normal bounds. I don't think there's any problem here except that you'd rather have a different schedule - but at 2 months it's healthier to let baby set the feeding schedule if possible.¬† | My girl is 5 months and she still eats every 2 hours this is normal, they‚Äôre growing a lot!! | My baby is 91st centile and has always eaten every 1.5-2 hours rarely goes 3h. She is nearly 7m! | At two months its very, very normal for babies to feed that frequently and it isn't a sign theyre being underfed.  Neither is milk that looks more watery.  All milk is around 90+% water and in warmer months that increases to make sure that your baby is well hydrated.  Fat plugs are more or less a social media creation to make you feel like you need to buy some kind of lactation supplement or a special pump, and theyre not indicative that your baby isn't having their nutritional needs met.

All you need to worry about is this:

- is baby gaining weight/staying on the same growth centile?
- is baby making plenty of wet and dirty nappies?
- does baby seem generally well in themselves?

If the answer to all 3 is yes, then chances are everything is pretty much fine.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

This was going to be a foreword in the original post, but I was just barely above the character limit for the post.

This is a complete, 19,000-word historical horror novella inspired by the events leading up to the Battle of Blair Mountain. I wrote the first draft 6 weeks ago, and was surprised to see Wendi post a video about the coal wars yesterday.

I'll be posting it here in four(ish) parts over the next few days. For those who prefer a single file, feel free to send me a message and I can send you a download of the print-ready PDF I made for getting the book printed via Amazon. Regardless, my main goal is just to share the story with an audience I think will appreciate it.

I went through the trouble of getting this novella print-ready for Amazon specifically so I can get my grandfather a physical copy of the book in time for his upcoming birthday.

Is it creepy?,,400,1758607011,"yes it's creepy. if i was in your shoes i will not feel safe enough to come back üò© | NOR. Tell him he‚Äôs made you uncomfortable and it‚Äôs inappropriate for him to contact you like this. Then block him and find a new cafe. I wouldn‚Äôt be scared, hopefully he‚Äôs just an idiot.¬†

In the event that he does continue to harass you, keep the screenshots of you asking him not to contact for future restraining orders! Hopefully it won‚Äôt come to that tho | So creepy! Something similar happened to my daughter. We went into a Best Buy and we were chatting with the employee. It turned out he recognized her from her work. We bought something using her information. Before we even made it home, she got a request on Insta from someone with an emoji that looked like him and initials that matched his. She did not accept. | Insanely wild thing to do. NOR. I work in a kitchen and even when FOH staff pop up as suggested I would never just randomly follow them and message them. Doing it to a customer is absolutely wild and unhinged. | All of you are clearly OR..  
Just turn him down, nothing more, nothing less. easy. Just a friendly not interested should get the job done.  
If that doesn't get the job done, then it becomes a problem. Right now? just innocent interest into you. | For every story we see a ""why did he contact me, WTF"" we see another ""why WON'T he contact me, WTF?"".

While it is unprofessional, and his ""I'm a detective har har"" answer is very on the ick side, it's not wrong for a guy to shoot his shot.  That's all this is.  He's not stalking you.  A simple ""thanks but no thanks"" is all that's needed here.

BTW his ""detective work"" was his phone detecting you using Instagram nearby.  It's not difficult to do.  Still creepy, and unprofessional, but not illegal.

If he is oggling you or w/e from now then yes report...but consider: he was taking a chance because maybe he misunderstood some signals, or he's full of himself, or whatever.  He could lose his job over this, and while probably not a BIG deal long term, you could screw up his life/give him a very negative view on women going forward.

Does he deserve it or not, I dunno.  But I would be more inclined to act with grace and let things be as long as he acts mature and stops talking to you outside of what is required to make you coffee. | Well... **social media apps will often recommend people to you based on geolocation and demographics- so realistically this might have nothing to do with him/them using personal information to find you.**

I totally respect that you might feel uncomfortable, but if you're wrong about your assumption here and it causes damage you could actually be at fault here... Everything you and others are saying hinges on the idea that a person looked you up intentionally using information gleamed from a payment form, or customer data without considering the way that social media platforms are actually known to connect people. **One common way friend suggestions work is through a skip list algorithm, which can easily recommend friends or display suggested content from secondary and tertiary connections.**

If you are geographically or socially close enough to be a regular at a specific cafe, this would be a **reasonable** assumption. The other questions would be, **why would this person add you now instead of a long time ago?**

If you don't want to be talked to or connected with, theres really is no way for a person to know that other than you to decline their advance and say **no**. If you are the same age, and there is no power dynamics or evidence of illegal use of information then you really don't have a case here in the literal sense of getting someone in trouble/fired.

However, **i do understand your feelings**. Trauma responses, as legitimate as they feel, can often be **hyper-vigilant** as well. But considering you haven't done the basics of communicating to this person i think you should really take a step back and evaluate this in a more mature way. It's a skill and regardless of gender, **clear communication will always be an important skill in life.** If you resort to condemnation and public scrutiny, while **conflating interpersonal interest with being threat**, then you might keep him and other guys away... but also without nuance you could also just become a bully who isn't in control of how you respond as well.

The fact that you had to post this on reddit tells me you may not have the support you need in the real world. And i think that makes a huge difference in how we emotionally respond to uncomfortable situations.

Im not trying to defend them, but i am trying to at least offer a balanced perspective that isnt based on feeding fear.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ive had people i loosely know show up as recommendations before and i may or may not add them based on if it seems like they're cool or not.

I think it really just depends on context. But if you're uncomfortable you should just ignore the request or be very plain with him/them. No need to explain yourself, just **ask for what you want/need in this situation.**

Theres no sense in calling someone a creep, because it seems like you're making some assumption that he went and sought you out- which may not be the case at all. **What would make it creepy is if you distanced your self or asked him/them to leave you alone, and they did not.**

Regardless of gender, you have to be comfortable with defining and communicating boundaries- and **you dont need to be dramatic or paranoid to do that**. Plus its digital, and this person is likely aware of that as well.

\---

**Being paranoid and afraid doesn't actually make the world safer.** Acting like somoene who can communicate and establish boundaries does... Believe it or not, girls do this to guys also and can be just as creepy... | So many people jumping to the worst possible scenario! You‚Äôre putting the cart out in front of the horse. So he shot his shot and it wasn‚Äôt well received‚Ä¶ completely fine, that‚Äôs life. Calling the person a stalker; getting that person fired; moving to a different cafe - Ludicrously odd; shoot first and ask questions later scenario! | Jesus, it's like 5 minutes of work to find someone on social media. He slid into your DMs and shot his shot. If you're not interested, JUST SAY SO. Communicate. All of the chronically online weirdos commenting about reporting him, etc, go touch grass, maybe talk to a real human sometime? 

Maybe he wanted to shoot his shot in person, but there was never time for him to say something? Regardless, it's perhaps forward of him to message you like that out of the blue, but nothing ever happens if somebody doesn't have the bravery to make the first move.

If you say you aren't interested and he continues to push the point, that's when blocking and reporting would be appropriate. But he literally asked if you minded if he got to know you better. | At this stage you don‚Äôt know if he searched for you or you happened to come up, algorithms are really weird and pick up on all sorts like location.  And you obviously have a non private account if he was able to see it and message you. So it would be unreasonable to go to his manager and jeopardise his job based on this message. Set a boundary and if he ignores it then take further action. | This is the modern day version of asking you out in person. Out here acting like ""sliding in the dms"" isn't a social norm now. I've had women randomly message me on multiple occasions in the past from the gym who I never interacted with in person. As strange as it may seem, this is essentially the digital age norm of approaching someone you're interested in. 

It's so easy to find people on social media these days with just a first name and a face that for some people It is infinitely easier to look them up and shoot a message instead of facing the anxiety of getting rejected in person. 

It's not my style. Personally I would never do it. But I can understand that the digital age has changed the face of dating to a place where this is common behavior and absolutely not ""stalking"". If you're not interested just reject him and both of you move on. Then next time you consider sliding in someone's dms, remember how your reacted to it | My barista asked what my weekend plans were and thinking this was normal small talk I shared what I was up to. When I arrived at the venue I was going to I was shocked and uncomfortable to see him there. He then had the audacity to say ‚Äúfinally! I‚Äôve been waiting here for you for hours!‚Äù like I was late for his stalking plans‚Ä¶

Definitely NOR. Just because you see someone often (in their workplace might I add!), doesn‚Äôt give them the right to contact you outside of this interaction. | I'm not sure if it is creepy. You have an open insta, he found it, he tired his luck. Not that there is much opportunity to get to know each other nowadays. You can just say no, if he is still pushing, than it is creepy.   
  
(I guess most of the people here will not agree with me, but ask the question from yourself: if the guy is handsome, and you like him, would this post exist?) | He should have asked you in person like a real man. That would have been the not creepy way and mature way to go about it. | instagram will show you to people you walk near in real life

  
if you genuinely go there every day,

he didn't have to search for you.

  
the algorithm knows who you are next to in real life. This is not a conspiracy, this is how instagram/social media works. 

  
google keeps track of the people around you. | Whilst yes this is creepy, and I'd urge you to not go back to the coffee place, it does amuse me how people have their entire lives available to the public on social media, yet complain when someone approaches them on it. ü§∑ | ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èHey so check your location and make sure it‚Äôs not turned on ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è maybe they saw it while you were in the coffee shop | ""You seem lost. I don't have a favourite batista. Do not contact me again.""

Yes it's creepy to be a service worker & think it's ok to casually message a customer without their consent. The ego on this prick needs a reminder that he isn't worth enduring just for coffee. | Dear lord, the man made a pass, if it's unwelcome say so. If he continues its creepy. All these people promoting fear, like is it safe to go back? Jesus of course it is. There was nothing crazy here it was a ""hey I want to get to know you"" having a public social media profile means sometimes the public contacts you. To say you feel unsafe is an overreaction and playing victim. 

If he continues after a refusal is another story however, that when you make complaints and a fuss, there he's not respecting your wishes. 

Woman want men to make the first move but this is the reaction from a pretty vanilla DM. The comments are wild. | Yes, you are overreacting in my opinion. What is wrong with seeing someone you like, and finding a way to ask them out? 

You can say no if you want to! If he asked you whilst he was working, that is more unprofessional. 

He used the internet to find your publically available information. You are the one who controls your available information. 

If no one can ask someone out because the slightest request is considered ""creepy"" then by the time you hit your 30s you'll all be single wondering where the good men are and then hit 40 and realise you are childless.

Seriously lighten up everyone! This is coming from a woman in her early 40s - luckily I'm happily married but I have so many unhappy single friends!

Otherwise any non-espresso focused flat burr with good alignment mechanism like 064s, Philos, etc or the Lagom Casa. 064s and Philos you can upgrade with SSP MP and other burr sets if that‚Äôs something you wanna play with. 

Though if the plan is to do many back to back drinks frequently, the Casa, 064s and some of the others may struggle to do many back to back drinks. If that‚Äôs the case consider Philos / Eureka Atom

DF54 probably does well too but no comment on switching back and forth, that‚Äôs an issue with many grinders.

Like how you would review red tea with red tea charecteristics and judge accordingly. 

As for matcha latte, the best ratio is 8-2 where 8 parts matcha and 2 parts milk. Similar to coffee's ratio. 

The reason why you see things backwards 8-2 ratio in social media and in the western world is that they don't know which milk to blend with the specific type of matcha that they are using. It's the safetest just to drown the greens with white. Hence it's just matcha flavored milk as opposed to matcha latte.

There are many types of matchas in Japan and eaech has their own taste profile. For professionals within the sadou commnunity, we often know what to pair it with especially what kind of milk.

The safetest milk that is often use is Hokkaido Milk. This is due to it's sweetness and of course blends well with majority of matchas. Again use the 8-2 ratio (8 parts matcha and not the other way around). | i want to try it so bad! i think next time i order matcha ill get the roasted ni if i can. it sounds right up my alley!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

But I'm glad you're getting this checked.  

They will most likely do a visual check of the area for obvious signs of hemorrhoids.    If that checks out, they'll probably start by treating you for that and refer you on for further tests to make sure it's not more serious.

A go pro up the ass sounds awful but in reality is your best bet for ruling out anything serious. Request a sedation (though it should be offered) and remember that everyone who cares about their health goes through it.   Docs and nurses do this procedure a lot and to them it's no different than any other medical test.   

Digital exams are used for prostate cancer and some vaginal/uterine exams.   They aren't useful for colon issues.

Explain your situation, what you're doing to get through it, and how that is helping. | Yeah, I don't really care how uncomfortable it is or embarrassing. I just want to be alive and do stupid stuff with my friends. 

I'm thinking it's hemorrhoids as well just because I had a very painful bowel movement and a pretty huge one, one time, and that's when the bleeding started. The pain is better, but I get the blood off and on, only once this month I've gotten it I think...?

Though if the plan is to do many back to back drinks frequently, the Casa, 064s and some of the others may struggle to do many back to back drinks. If that‚Äôs the case consider Philos / Eureka Atom

DF54 probably does well too but no comment on switching back and forth, that‚Äôs an issue with many grinders.

My wife and I have been married for 7 years and together for ten. We are both avid motorcyclists and spend quite a bit of time riding, although often separately.

I would not buy a new house with your future ex wife. You are being taken for a ride. Put a gps tracker on her bike and you will see.

That way there‚Äôs no need to to keep communication going (which I understand can be smothering for her), and you know where she is at all times. 

You both seem to have an issue and both don‚Äôt listen to each other and fixate on their own. Search for a solution for both issues together as a team (like the one I mentioned perhaps) | You are right to feel betrayed. Your wife is repeatedly lying to you. Very likely far more than you are aware. You are quite right not to trust her. She has proven herself untrustworthy.


You must also know that there is a considerable chance she is having an affair.


The fact that she is not truly apologetic, and trying to make it about you, would be the final nail in the coffin for me. It's hard for us to judge, maybe you are insecure. But at the least, she's given you plenty of good reason for that insecurity. Given the lack of remorse, it is hard to see how trust can ever be rebuilt.


Do you have kids? If not, I would be out of there immediately. | NOR, something is off and she is hiding something or someone. Classic cheaters will make you look crazy/ insecure and will gaslight you to oblivion because op the evidence is there. Don‚Äôt let love blind you to who she really is. | Depends- was it the I didn‚Äôt touch your fries. Kind of lie, or the ‚Äòwe totally don‚Äôt need to hire a plumber ‚Äòkind of lie ? One‚Äôs cute, the other ends with a flooded bathroom | The fuck?
Why you let her walk over you??
Time to call PI.
You should dot it way long before..


Even if she doesn't cheat, a marriage like that sound exhausting. | That‚Äôs not a white lie, that‚Äôs straight up lying with the intention of hiding something. | You have to talk seriously, you have serious problems, either she listens to you, or you have to divorce, there must be seriousness on both sides, she tells too many lies, ok the desire to escape, but she seems to have other desires too | Updateme | So I did actually walk into the bar. She appeared to be sitting there alone. I didn‚Äôt hang around long though. The thought of a gps tracker has crossed my mind but I have never followed through with it. | I appreciate this suggestion. I recommended the location tracker previously only when she‚Äôs out late riding. She did not like the suggestion and it never ended up happening. | My wife and I share our location always. I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt if you‚Äôre married. I‚Äôm never in a place I shouldn‚Äôt be and I‚Äôm in the woods or on the water a lot so she can find me if there‚Äôs a problem. If I‚Äôm on my way home she can get my eta and she can plan around it. Marriage shouldn‚Äôt be this hard. There‚Äôs privacy and there‚Äôs secrecy. She‚Äôs chosen lies and secrecy.¬† | This behaviour is really weird, it is certainly not normal by any measure. It sounds like you may well be over compensating and being overly pushy with requiring her reporting in on location as well, however I can well understand why given her apparent lack of willingness to provide any information. It doesn‚Äôt sound like she is doing anything particularly wrong, but this bullshit and gaslighting does appear as shady as hell and it would not be unreasonable to come to the conclusion that something more is going on. 
I don‚Äôt know what to suggest as you have tried therapy, and still she lies and then proceeds to gaslight you, all round shitty behaviour to be honest‚Ä¶. | Oh bummer. Why does she not like it? I would try it again and frame it as so she can have her way too with not having to text. 

Some people do just not like it, beats me though. | These are very much my thoughts! I don‚Äôt automatically imagine she is doing something wrong. I do believe her behavior is strange and it‚Äôs causing me to come to my own conclusions. I feel like my reactions are very normal husband behavior but it‚Äôs been spun to make it seem like I‚Äôm being overly needy and uncompromising. I really just want better communication. | I would be willing to try it again and reframe it. Maybe not having to get messages from me might help her feel less ‚Äúsmothered‚Äù. I just worry that she will respond by telling me I‚Äôm insecure for requesting her location and that it is a ‚Äúweird‚Äù thing to ask.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it. Or will it just be a sub par machine in my kitchen when I‚Äôm already pulling good shots with my beginner dedica. | IMS shower screen is a mod I would like to add to the list!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

I have gone on plenty of cruises on various lines where I had a group in multiple cabins and got drinks for others, just be discreet about it.

At dinner in the MDR is fine.¬† Continental breakfast is free with hang tag. That can include a carafe of coffee. | Can I add on a question? If we have two people in the cabin, both with Plus, and we want to order a meal in, can one person order both meals or do we order separately? | Thanks! First time cruising. I didn't pick up on that when it was showing me options in the app. Appreciate it! | This is correct. And you amy not get drinks of any kind for someone without package or paying

But actually, I pull shots which are comparable and sometimes even better than my local specialty coffee shops. I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",19,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it.

[Koimaro](https://s.shopee.ph/BKXy8rY7z) - slight bitterness, a bit umami

If you want recos ng local brand (but sourced in Japan), meron rin ako. Hahaha super dami ko na natry, even hojicha. Mostly available in IG tho. Tsaka paunahan talaga | Hello OP! 

Pinaka recommended na matcha is iyong **[Adoleaf Matcha 4A](https://s.shopee.ph/1g9BApt4Yy)** ceremonial grade iyan. Ano bang prefer mo?? Marami kasing iba't-ibang types e. Seaweed and nutty notes iyan. Not bitter and perfect to mix with latte!

Also, recommended ko rin iyong **[CAPI Hoshi Blend](https://s.shopee.ph/9pUsu4MWMX)**  may umami atake nito. Super sarap hindi bitter tasting! Alam mong good quality!

**[Tsujiri Latte](https://s.shopee.ph/1g9BBJpY0A)** is also affordable OP product is from Japan din talaga. Balance lasa nito sweet & bitter yet creamy for me.

761,matcha powder,Indiemakeupandmore,What are your sexiest scents (whatever that means to you)?,"Hi, inspired by the spirit of encouraging engagement on this sub via enjoying what we have, I'd love to hear what you think are your sexiest scents!

This can mean whatever it means to you - what makes you feel sexy, what has sexy scent associations, what seems objectively sexy to you? 

I've realized that I tend to enjoy red musks, which are often described as sexy, but I find quite cozy - for example, I really enjoy **Cirrus Parfum's Sybarite (red champaca absolute, red mandarin, a deeply sexy...",38,1758564469,"I feel like darker floral scents, femme fatale vibes, make me feel sexiest. That‚Äôs not what my husband appreciates, but it‚Äôs what I personally feel the most attractive wearing. If I could find a good indie similar to Penhaligons Halfeti, that‚Äôs what I would wear all the time.

Another scent profile I find attractive is spicy-sweet gourmand. Marten with a Vengeance (Osmo) and UFO Disco (Sorce) are examples of that. 

That goes hand in hand with the third category, spiced/boozy vanillas. Think Forever Red (vanilla rum) from BBW, Gjallorjorn from Arcana, Black Mass from Hex. 


PS:
Not to be political or anything, but I wish society didn‚Äôt expect men to just want to smell like tobacco or whiskey. For that matter, I, a cis female, enjoy whiskey scents for myself! My husband likes sweet, dessert-gourmands much more than I do, so when something is too sweet for me, I often give it to him. I think it‚Äôs getting better though. More and more people are buying into the idea that perfume/scents don‚Äôt need to be assigned to a gender. Maybe it‚Äôs mostly the bottles that are the problem- a dude might enjoy MJ Daisy, but does he necessarily want to display that bottle on his dresser? | I feel like there are a lot of traditonally sexy scents that are just very not me, so I don‚Äôt know that these hit that way for other people, but here are some scents that make me feel hot for various reasons.    

Morari‚Äôs **Bandit** - Whiskey, Neroli, Nutmeg, Vetiver - this makes me feel like I could win a bar fight (i could not, please use responsibly). It‚Äôs got a very western hotness.   

Stone and Wit‚Äôs **Turyin** - Pomegranate, plum wine, sandalwood, gunpowder - darkly fruity and sexy, the gunpowder adds a weird and fun edge.   

Fyrinnae‚Äôs **Mediterranean Merman** - Salt water is strongly dominant, followed by sun-warmed rocks intertwined with violet leaf, ambrette, sandalwood, wild orchid, and just a slight touch of pomegranate - perfect for a more masc sexy, smells like some babe you‚Äôd meet on a fancy vacation for a night.   

Cardinal Scents‚Äô **Sugar Haze** - spun sugar, pink Himalayan salt, sea amber, white musk. - salty and musky and a little sweet, sometimes I layer this one when I want a little more sexiness to a scent. | I'm a newb and haven't found it yet! To me, it'd be a sultry rich rose, probably a bit of spice (clove, cardamom, or ginger) and something a little dark and mysterious, maybe woodsmoke. I used to live in Tokyo and go to goth/alternative events and want something that reminds me of that or that would have felt appropriate to wear then. If anyone has recs, I'm all ears! | For me, a sexy scent is something earthy, creamy, spicy, and only a little sweet. Something about that combination reads carnal and lusty to my nose, like an idealized version of sweaty skin. If it‚Äôs too sweet, it‚Äôll smell like food and food isn‚Äôt that sexy to me. And I like a little spice in there because it reads sassy to me and that‚Äôs more my vibe of sexiness. 

The perfume I own that best meets those criteria is Immortal Pefume‚Äôs VIII (Vegan Ambergris, Belladonna*, Peru Balsam, Clovebud, Tobacco, Bay Leaf, Fire). To me, it smells like a fancy lady holding an unlit clove cigarette that she‚Äôs about to light.

However, I‚Äôm forever on the hunt for a sexy sandalwood perfume. One of the sexiest perfumes I‚Äôve ever encountered was worn by a friend of mine who said she was wearing a random solid perfume that was pure sandalwood, and she had no idea where she got it or what the brand was. It was the perfect mix of earthy, creamy, sweet, and spicy. 

Sadly most sandalwood perfumes I‚Äôve tried since then have been too dry and powdery for me, including Alkemia‚Äôs Arabesque. My mom loves using body powder, so unfortunately dry and powdery scents remind me too much of her to feel sexy lol | I personally find darker notes and darker fragrances to be really seductive. Possets' Toccata and Fugue in D Minor is incredible, and has developed into something dark and goth and lovely that reminds me of wine despite wine not being listed in the notes. It's seductive but dangerous feeling, and it fits its description perfectly.¬†


I also think animalic scents are really seductive, and Debauchery by BPAL is an example of this.¬†


Iago by BPAL also feels really seductive, but I think that's a minority opinion.¬† | When I think of my sexiest scents, I think spicy, sweet, and dark fruity. 


Hexxenacht Noir: On me, this is mainly a dark and deep resinous cherry. Just sweet enough and perfect for a night out. 
Notes: tonka bean, tobacco leaf, vanilla, black cherry, pipe tobacco, maraschino, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum, Peru balsam, benzoin, sandalwood, black pepper, pink peppercorn, clove.

Sorce Fuckery: This is very similar to the above Noir on me, but the cinnamon note, and the overall general sweetness of Sorce scents, turns this into a gorgeous winter spice. 
Notes: Luxardo cherry, caramelized sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood, tobacco absolute, smoke, night air, clean sheets

Hexennacht Black Mass: This to me is deliciously unholy! I get a liturgical smoke, the resins, and the sweetness from the marshmallows. 
Notes: smoked vanilla, frankincense, Peru balsam, labdanum, amber, vetiver, atlas cedarwood, patchouli, night musk, and scorched marshmallows.


Hexennacht Crowley: This is probably my sexiest scents I own. Both my partner and I use it and love using it for nights out/date nights. I think it‚Äôs the perfect unisex scent. On me, I get the black tea (I LOVE Caroline‚Äôs black tea note), as well as the bergamot. The tobacco and amber mix so well and the vanilla rounds it out to be the perfect spicy sweet black tea. 
Notes: black tea, bergamot, tobacco, vanilla, amber.

Alkemia Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure: this to me is overtly feminine. Sexy on the lighter more soft side. It‚Äôs powdery, sweet, and airy. On me I don‚Äôt get the Jasmine or the incense and smell more of the pralines, cashmere, orchid, and orris. 
Notes: An opulence of cashmere sensuously perfumed with rare Japanese boudoir incenses, luxurious caramel pralines, vanilla orchids, bergamot, orris root, candied lemon peel, and a splash of champagne.

Olympic Orchids Red Cattleya: this is also sexy on the more airy/feminine side. The initial opening is sweet and floral, and the dry down is powdery floral. It just feels pretty, so so pretty. 
Notes: citrus, peach, apricot, melon, hyacinth, gardenia, violets lilac, dark musk, exotic woods and vanilla. | I tend to feel sexiest in earthy or green scents!   
  
**Dandelion Butter by Clue perfumery** feels like rolling in the grass with my lover and when we come up for air we're covered in milky sap from the crushed dandelion stems. **(Pollen, dandelion greens, yellow dandelion, snapped stem, milky sap, salted butter, dandelion-stained chin)**

**Golden Hour by SAMAR** is like cozy afterglow when our bodies are warm and entwined and we're minutes from melting into a post-sex nap. **Spiced honey mead, roasted peaches, clotted cream, dried herbs, cedar, musk** | I haven‚Äôt really found the central ‚Äútheme‚Äù that makes a scent sexy to me but I definitely have some scents that have given me that impression!

**Cult of Dionysus** from Pierrot Perfumery (fresh figs, ripe and juicy pears, honey, red wine, honey mead) I raved about the sexiness of this scent in my other review, and that‚Äôs because of the warmth, depth, and sweetness of it. It feels really welcoming and sweet, but the depth from the wine and mead really brings it into the ‚Äúsexy‚Äù zone for me.¬†

**Wildwood** from Topanga Window (sumac, vanilla, birch) This scent is like a hot woodworker lol. It‚Äôs got some sweetness from the vanilla, but the birch itself also smells kind of sappy and sweet. It lingers really well on me too, and the way it fades the second day makes me feel really sexy.¬†

**Satyr** from Haus of Gloi (Italian blood orange, blackened vanilla) This scent is simple but it just WORKS for me. The blackened vanilla makes the orange smell almost spiced without being drowned in cinnamon and cloves. It stays on my skin forever too, I think the pumpkin butter form makes it cling really nicely to my skin AND makes my skin super soft which also makes me sexier imo. | My go to date night perfume is hands down **Pierrot's Vampyr** (*A true amber perfume, sweet and musky*) it's just slinky and seductive and I always feel sexy wearing it. Also from Pierrot is **Heirophilia** (*An absolutely hedonistic blend of frankincense, myrrh, lit incense, and sex*) if you're looking for a mood to match that confessional scene in Fleabag. **Solstice Scents Conjure** (*A Magical Blend of Vanilla, Amber, Cedar, Spices & Cauldron Smoke*) is a great sassy witch scent, one of my only witchy scents without gourmand notes which, I agree, aren't sexy. On the off chance I'm looking for something more traditionally feminine smelling, I might reach for **SSE Yennifer Bold** (*Purple Lilac, Gooseberries, Black Suede, Ancient Woods*) or **Wyld Ivy's Rogue & Siren** (*Smokey and scandalous and utterly irresistible. Wood smoke on the autumn breeze, smoldering charcoal, burnt vanilla, and a kiss of black honey*) I didn't find this one that sexy at first, kind of just nice in a pretty/smokey way, but it's really grown on me. | Apsara by Fantome. I just received a sample a few weeks ago but will definitely be FSing as it's quickly become my favorite. I'm always a sucker for fig, the hibiscus is so pretty, and the patchouli here gives me very sexy bohemian. It makes me feel like I'm in my element - sexy, playful, freespirited 

*Juicy black figs and hibiscus nectar are at the heart of this luscious, syrupy fragrance tempered by smooth patchouli, iris, resinous woods, aged frankincense, benzoin, and spices.* | I feel so sexy when I wear my sample of Poesie‚Äôs *Eat Me* (peach lavender cake with marshmallow frosting and currants.)

Part of it‚Äôs the name (lol), but honestly, most of the sexy feeling comes from the scent itself. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of fruity and sweet and with a just a touch of bite from the lavender. Despite being a cake scent, I wouldn‚Äôt really describe it as gourmand. 

Unfortunately, I only have a sample, and they don‚Äôt sell it anymore! I‚Äôm hoping they reopen/offee their Alice in Wonderland collection at some point so that I can pick it up! | I love all these questions!¬†


I am a big fan of a vanilla musk that isn't too gourmand to feel most me. I love NAVA Crystalline Musk (really any with Crystalline) and Vanilla Musk. I think they tend to amplify a natural skin scent with a little something extra. My husband loves those ones as well and I think I've somehow tricked him into being addicted to their Strawberries and Cream Musk. I had to grab a backup recently! I don't think I own any more traditional sexy smelling scents but I feel most confident in myself when my perfume matches my vibe for the day and those ones sort of always lead to feeling a bit more feminine and put together.¬†


I also think that Sorce Falling Stars Vanilla Sweet Cream is more gourmand than the other vanillas but it's very intoxicating. I love to wear that one.¬† | I think sexy scents need a musk note, fruit and flowers just won't cut it. I like **Judith** by Treading Water | Howl and Mistress of Power by Possets, Smut by BPAL. | I would have to say Serpentine by Sorce. Although I don‚Äôt know that many would agree. I generally dislike darker scents that are typically considered sex. Red musk is a deal breaker for me. I wish I liked it, but I just don‚Äôt. | I discovered BPAL when one of my friends raved that they ""just bought the HORNIEST perfumes!""  I have a strong affinity for them to this day for that reason.  I love their horny perfumes!

Something complex that's a little smoky and a little sweet seems to be the skeleton formula to me.  Perversion remains my favourite - leather and booze with some smoke and sweetness, and of course the name.

The Dark Chocolate Rider and Red Lantern fit that bill pretty closely too, albeit much more foody with rich dessert scents mixed in.  Not such a bad thing to taste like a treat though.

I got Dahlia recently and have only tried it once so far, but I really like it and think it fits this formula too, with orchid and cardamom as the differentiators.

Aroused Demon is another favourite.  If not for the name, I don't know if I'd think of it as a scent that's supposed to be sexy, it's just filled with scents that I really like a lot.  But I also love it for the name.

Of the seemingly much more popular horny perfumes, both Smut and Debauchery are really, really good musks (and names), but to me they are like only wearing base notes and should be layered with other interesting scents.  Now that this question has me thinking about it, I should experiment with combining them with semi-sweet and spiced perfumes...  I have tried Lust and Smut together, and that was a good combo.  I got Lust for the name alone, and I don't recall liking the scent that much at first (I'm not a big patchouli fan), but it's now aged 3.5 years and it smells great, like nothing I remember trying. | I love reading my how different people‚Äôs sexy scents are! In general I find sensual resins and cashmere, to be notes I feel sexy wearing. 

For ‚Äògoing out sexy‚Äô:
Alkemia Amour de Ambre - A passionate love song of honeyed Madagascar vanilla, white orchids, bay rum, Mysore sandalwood, and six of our finest Arabian ambers exquisitely aged in charred cedar. Both as simple and as complex as the love of a thousand hearts.
(It‚Äôs so warm and beautiful!)

Alkemia Cherries of the Night - Black cherries, Maraschino liqueur, Cherry amber, Black amber, Spiced rum, Peru balsam. 
(If I could only pick one sexy scent, it would be this one!)

‚ÄòEveryday sexy‚Äô:
Death and Floral The Sweater we Buried You With is Hanging in My Closet -  a lush blend of three different vanillas, resinous ambers, Arabian sandalwood and soft cashmere sweater. 

Poesie Habibi - cardamom, amber honey in the comb, cinnamon + ginger, an opulent amber blended of precious resins and dark vanilla, henna flower, sandalwood incense

Alkemia Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure - An opulence of cashmere sensuously perfumed with rare Japanese boudoir incenses, luxurious caramel pralines, vanilla orchids, bergamot, orris root, candied lemon peel, and a splash of champagne. 
(I think the name contributes lol)

Sorce Between The Sheets: Figs, cream, beeswax absolute, cashmere, wool, skin musk                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Sorce UFO Disco: Mango lassi sprinkled with cardamom, guava, amyris wood and a holographic vanilla musk

Arcana Underwater Cities- An opening of our hand-extracted rosemary oil, sweet anise, and pure beeswax absolute leads to a heart of salt-encrusted Ambroxan, slanting sunbeams, sheer cedarwood, French seaweed absolute, and a touch of coastal wildflowers.
(This is something of a wild card but the earthiness and saltiness are funky-sexy!) | I also like that kind of scent, so here are ones I‚Äôve noticed:

I‚Äôd recommend trying one/some of BPALS serpents- Serpent in the Roses would be a good place to start, but Serpent in the Carnations (carnation, snake oil, clove) would also be a good one to try. Blood Kiss (Lush, creamy vanilla and the honey of the sweetest kiss smeared with the vital throb of husky clove, swollen red cherries, but darkened with the vampiric sensuality of vetiver, soporific poppy and blood red wine, and a skin-light pulse of feral musk), and Romans 13:8 (Almond, wild fig, red rose petals, cardamom, and oudh) would also be good options. 

Of those BPALs, I‚Äôve tried Blood Kiss (didn‚Äôt care for it, too much vetiver) and both Serpents. I really like Serpent in the Carnations but I thought it was too strong to wear to work and then it was gone from the Luper event. But I imagine it will be back next year. 

From Alkemia, maybe look at [Hell Courtisan](https://alkemiaperfumes.com/products/hell-courtisan?_pos=8&_sid=0ca583c30&_ss=r) (why is it spelled that way?), Venym (A dark sensuality of black roses, saffron infused oud, neroli, bergamot, star jasmine, black vanilla, limoo amani, Darjeeling tea, dark aged patchouli, ebony wood, opium, and black amber), and Dark Goddess. I like Dark Goddess but the civet kind of bothers me, I do not like Venym, and have not tried the first one but it looks like a good fit. | You might want to try BPAL's Harlot, it's sultry rose with cinnamon.  And of course it's just as good for the name. | Maybe Pacifica Sandalwood solid perfume? I wore that ages ago and remember it being earthy and spicy but also fresher than most sandalwoods I've come across if somewhat simple.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

780,cold brew tea,StanleyKubrick,"The ""offness"" of so many Kubrick scenes","For all the enormous amount written about Kubrick and his films, I don't see a lot of detailed discussion of this (beyond general references to ""cold"" performances and the like).

I rewatched 2001 recently, I've been obsessed with it most of my life but it's actually been quite a few years. The thing that struck me this time was how bizarre the scenes with Floyd are, ie after the apes but before Jupiter.

Of course the VFX sequences are stunning, and the final scene on the moon (with the monolit...",10,1758612794,"The redchair scene is one of my favorite dialogue-centric scenes ever specifically *because* of the underlying tension building through the dramatic irony, all which fuels our own anticipation for finding out what has happened on the Moon.

Kubrick loved the films portraying reality in a dreamlike *(or nightmarish)* way, so the conflict and general interactions were often more subtle and layered beneath the surface. | Highly trained people tend not to dramatically over react irl. It is refreshing to me that Kubrick shows this level of professionalism rather than resort to melodrama. Apollo 13 is a great example. After seeing the film Jim Lovell complained to Ron Howard that none of the astronauts lost their cool at any time despite their terrifying circumstances. Astronauts are trained and selected to avoid panicking during highly stressful situations. Ron's response was something to the effect of ""it's a movie, we have to show tension to move the story along"". Thankfully Kubrick was able to move his story along without resorting to dramatic shenanigans. | Just a quick reflection on the scenes with the red sofas/chairs: I understand what you‚Äôre seeing and saying, and I really don‚Äôt want to sound arrogant, but I think there‚Äôs a lot going on underneath the niceties. I‚Äôd say the defense is an example of masterful lying. The Russian (who‚Äôs over the top acting is one of my big joys, both in 2001 and Barry Lyndon) has been fed the misinformation about an outbreak of some kind as an explanation for why the American base shut things off and Floyd declines to say anything, making it seem like an admission. So you might not like the scene, or it might not have a traditional sense of ‚Äúdrama‚Äù, but to ME (obviously subjective) it‚Äôs a beautiful scene. Both the acting, as i mention that I love, and the way of slowly letting us in on the story as it unfolds. | I‚Äôve known a few science education people who told me they find 2001 really boring. They want more action. I didn‚Äôt know why they needed that but maybe it‚Äôs because it reminded them too much of work. | I think Tarantino does something similar with the dialogue in his films in that at least at first, you probably don't understand why the characters are seemingly talking about things that are seemingly irrelevant to the plot and the character's motivations. There's definitely a conflict that's established and built up in the scenes with clear beginning, middle, and end of said conflicts, but you probably don't know where this conflict ties into the overall plot of them in where they're heading towards because the stakes aren't melodramatically played out.

Like in the opening to *Reservoir Dogs*, you see a group of men in matching suits having breakfast together at a diner having debates over a Madonna song and one of them not believing tipping culture.

I think you when first watch the movie all the way through, you might not understand what exactly the whole point of that opening was, but on a second rewatch, you might notice a lot was revealed about these character's personalities and motivations in the span of about 8 minutes and what they're already plotting for the heist mission.

Maybe not a ""cold"" opening in the way you're referring to, but I think this post is an interesting perspective on this topic! | Niceness is a weapon. Civility and discourse masks lethal intent. Those scenes are meant to feel performative and inauthentic because they are - everybody has their true feelings, motivations, and intentions, but they are submerged beneath a 'civilised' veneer. Some of the conversations reveal a shocking inhumanity, like the refusal to allow a craft in emergency to land - likely this was a ruse to uncover the secrets of the monolith site, but we don't know that for sure and neither did the US officials. They wouldn't help them either way.¬†


Or take the cover story which would cause a lot of suffering to people's worried families. They are carefully protecting the site using civility and information as potentially lethal weapons, just like the early hominids club each other to death to secure ownership of the watering hole. The lesson is - man has dressed itself up, cloaked itself in culture and technology, but remains the same basic animal: materialistic, self interested, and territorial. It hasn't truly evolved. That comes next | The way the exposition is delivered in that scene is really subtle; Kubrick credits his audience with intelligence. | ... and further to that, once the bar is lowered for melodrama, drama can then be portrayed in a way that is more realistic and therefore affecting.

Look at the scene where Dave Bowman reenters Discovery with the intention of shutting down HAL - Keir Dullea barely has a line throughout the entire sequence and his expression barely changes from a grim determination.  Yet with the established naturalism of the acting, the mere quickening of Bowman's respiration puts the audience on edge. | I agree the Jupiter astronauts come across as professional, and that makes those scenes all the more tense, compared to traditional heightened ""action"" sci-fi. But do you find the performances in the scenes I'm talking about (with Floyd) realistic? I find them odd and cold (again, I love the film and this isn't a criticism, just an observation).

Or maybe that \*is\* realistic (or certainly what Kubrick considered realistic), and most films are OTT? Either way the behaviour of the characters reads as strange and detached to me. | Absolutely not arrogant, and I can see your points. Just to be clear though, I'm absolutely not criticising the scenes at all. I'm saying I don't understand \*how\* they work given they break so many traditional rules of drama/cinema. But that they \*do\* work (for me) is unquetionable.

To be more specific: sure, the tension with the Russian contingent is there, and the information is brilliantly drip fed for maximum tension too. But there's a still a \*tonne\* of stuff around it that in traditional terms is ""unnecessary"". It's the opposite to the common screenwriting/directing rules of ""get in and out as early as you can"". There's so much shaking hands, smiling, everyone saying ""nice"" things to each other. And it's not played as tense, at least not in a remotely traditional way. But it's interesting to hear your visceral reaction is actually quite different to mine. | It's a curious observation. As a healthcare technician, I am most often disappointed by the cinematic representation of medical/surgical contexts precisely because they are not sufficiently realistic. And yes, Scrubs is the most realistic series ever in this sense. | That's a good comparison - I guess for me the difference is, Tarantino sweeps you along with obviously entertaining features like the humour in that scene, and the obviously fun/""appealing"" characters. (NB it keeps sounding like I'm criticising Kubrick and I don't mean to!)

But I get the connection, being the audience isn't been spoon fed plot per se. You have to sort of ""live through"" those scenes to get to the meat of the story.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

Here's the original text of the post:

I‚Äôm currently dating someone poly for the first time and developing really strong feelings for them. It was very clear from the beginning that being poly is rather non-negotiable for them and honestly i also felt like I didn‚Äôt want to date monogamously any more after my last monogamous relationship and was open to trying it. 

That person (let‚Äôs call them A) lives in another city and is also about to move even further away (currently it‚Äôs a two hour train ride but about to become an 8 hour one) which makes me a bit nervous but we both are open to figuring out what mode will work for us over the distance. I‚Äôm also currently dating someone who lives in the same city as I do but it‚Äôs a lot more casual. 

Since I‚Äôm new to poly, A and I had some conflicts about communication, for example because I announced that I was going on a date the same day or the day before even though it was longer. In general I still have this internalised feeling of guilt from being monogamous, which makes it harder for me to share things and in the past has made me omit things, like planned dates, hoping to avoid conflict but thereby making it worse because they feel like I‚Äôm being dishonest (which I think is really fair and I‚Äôm trying to be more transparent in the future). 

They aren‚Äôt seing anyone regularly at the moment but did when I started and they did have some hookups with a close friend of theirs and a fwb situation and a kind of romantic holiday fling. Some of these situations made me jealous briefly but I didn‚Äôt mind them a lot. A also has a person they used to date who lives in the same city as me. A thought they had ghosted them until they slid back into their life by liking an insta story and starting a conversation where they realised that that person moved to my city now. They met up for coffee while A was visiting me and ended up hooking up, which I also didn‚Äôt particularly mind in the moment. 

But somehow, when A announced that they wanna see them again something in me really resisted to that. I said it‚Äôs okay but I‚Äôm not feeling great about it (also bcs it doesnt really feel like we have veto rights for each other at the moment) but now that their next meet-up is planned I do realise that it makes me feel really anxious and shitty. I also kind of snapped at them when we talked about it and they asked me why I‚Äôm so bothered by it and I said it‚Äôs a mixture of just not liking the way that person came back into their life snd the feeling like I‚Äôm facilitating a thing I‚Äôm not part of (the other person would never visit A in their city, for example) but also I‚Äôm afraid that it‚Äôs gonna take away from the time we can see each other that is already limited. They reassured me that it won‚Äôt take away from our time and that they would only meet the other person for the extra day that they wouldn‚Äôt stay with me anyways. 

They also said that they feel like I have a double standard since I‚Äôm also seeing other people and they are more transparent about it and I don‚Äôt see how I hurt their feelings by not being transparent. 

I still feel really shitty about the prospect of them seeing the other person right after staying with me the next time they visit, but I feel like bringing it up again will make them feel like I‚Äôm being controlling and enhance the feeling of double standards. I‚Äôve also been wondering if it would help me to meet that other person, which A has already expressed they would like, but I feel like it could also have the opposite effect. 

I really don‚Äôt know how to bring it up again, but I‚Äôve had really bad anxiety around this and don‚Äôt want to be feeling this way. I‚Äôm also questioning if this kind of poly dating is right for me. I‚Äôd be really greatly for any thoughts, advice or sharing of similar experiences. Thank you üíï

What started as simple curiosity has turned into this whole world I get to explore.

826,how to make matcha,Indiemakeupandmore,What are your sexiest scents (whatever that means to you)?,"Hi, inspired by the spirit of encouraging engagement on this sub via enjoying what we have, I'd love to hear what you think are your sexiest scents!

This can mean whatever it means to you - what makes you feel sexy, what has sexy scent associations, what seems objectively sexy to you? 

I've realized that I tend to enjoy red musks, which are often described as sexy, but I find quite cozy - for example, I really enjoy **Cirrus Parfum's Sybarite (red champaca absolute, red mandarin, a deeply sexy...",38,1758564469,"I feel like darker floral scents, femme fatale vibes, make me feel sexiest. That‚Äôs not what my husband appreciates, but it‚Äôs what I personally feel the most attractive wearing. If I could find a good indie similar to Penhaligons Halfeti, that‚Äôs what I would wear all the time.

Another scent profile I find attractive is spicy-sweet gourmand. Marten with a Vengeance (Osmo) and UFO Disco (Sorce) are examples of that. 

That goes hand in hand with the third category, spiced/boozy vanillas. Think Forever Red (vanilla rum) from BBW, Gjallorjorn from Arcana, Black Mass from Hex. 


PS:
Not to be political or anything, but I wish society didn‚Äôt expect men to just want to smell like tobacco or whiskey. For that matter, I, a cis female, enjoy whiskey scents for myself! My husband likes sweet, dessert-gourmands much more than I do, so when something is too sweet for me, I often give it to him. I think it‚Äôs getting better though. More and more people are buying into the idea that perfume/scents don‚Äôt need to be assigned to a gender. Maybe it‚Äôs mostly the bottles that are the problem- a dude might enjoy MJ Daisy, but does he necessarily want to display that bottle on his dresser? | I feel like there are a lot of traditonally sexy scents that are just very not me, so I don‚Äôt know that these hit that way for other people, but here are some scents that make me feel hot for various reasons.    

Morari‚Äôs **Bandit** - Whiskey, Neroli, Nutmeg, Vetiver - this makes me feel like I could win a bar fight (i could not, please use responsibly). It‚Äôs got a very western hotness.   

Stone and Wit‚Äôs **Turyin** - Pomegranate, plum wine, sandalwood, gunpowder - darkly fruity and sexy, the gunpowder adds a weird and fun edge.   

Fyrinnae‚Äôs **Mediterranean Merman** - Salt water is strongly dominant, followed by sun-warmed rocks intertwined with violet leaf, ambrette, sandalwood, wild orchid, and just a slight touch of pomegranate - perfect for a more masc sexy, smells like some babe you‚Äôd meet on a fancy vacation for a night.   

Cardinal Scents‚Äô **Sugar Haze** - spun sugar, pink Himalayan salt, sea amber, white musk. - salty and musky and a little sweet, sometimes I layer this one when I want a little more sexiness to a scent. | I'm a newb and haven't found it yet! To me, it'd be a sultry rich rose, probably a bit of spice (clove, cardamom, or ginger) and something a little dark and mysterious, maybe woodsmoke. I used to live in Tokyo and go to goth/alternative events and want something that reminds me of that or that would have felt appropriate to wear then. If anyone has recs, I'm all ears! | For me, a sexy scent is something earthy, creamy, spicy, and only a little sweet. Something about that combination reads carnal and lusty to my nose, like an idealized version of sweaty skin. If it‚Äôs too sweet, it‚Äôll smell like food and food isn‚Äôt that sexy to me. And I like a little spice in there because it reads sassy to me and that‚Äôs more my vibe of sexiness. 

The perfume I own that best meets those criteria is Immortal Pefume‚Äôs VIII (Vegan Ambergris, Belladonna*, Peru Balsam, Clovebud, Tobacco, Bay Leaf, Fire). To me, it smells like a fancy lady holding an unlit clove cigarette that she‚Äôs about to light.

However, I‚Äôm forever on the hunt for a sexy sandalwood perfume. One of the sexiest perfumes I‚Äôve ever encountered was worn by a friend of mine who said she was wearing a random solid perfume that was pure sandalwood, and she had no idea where she got it or what the brand was. It was the perfect mix of earthy, creamy, sweet, and spicy. 

Sadly most sandalwood perfumes I‚Äôve tried since then have been too dry and powdery for me, including Alkemia‚Äôs Arabesque. My mom loves using body powder, so unfortunately dry and powdery scents remind me too much of her to feel sexy lol | I personally find darker notes and darker fragrances to be really seductive. Possets' Toccata and Fugue in D Minor is incredible, and has developed into something dark and goth and lovely that reminds me of wine despite wine not being listed in the notes. It's seductive but dangerous feeling, and it fits its description perfectly.¬†


I also think animalic scents are really seductive, and Debauchery by BPAL is an example of this.¬†


Iago by BPAL also feels really seductive, but I think that's a minority opinion.¬† | When I think of my sexiest scents, I think spicy, sweet, and dark fruity. 


Hexxenacht Noir: On me, this is mainly a dark and deep resinous cherry. Just sweet enough and perfect for a night out. 
Notes: tonka bean, tobacco leaf, vanilla, black cherry, pipe tobacco, maraschino, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum, Peru balsam, benzoin, sandalwood, black pepper, pink peppercorn, clove.

Sorce Fuckery: This is very similar to the above Noir on me, but the cinnamon note, and the overall general sweetness of Sorce scents, turns this into a gorgeous winter spice. 
Notes: Luxardo cherry, caramelized sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood, tobacco absolute, smoke, night air, clean sheets

Hexennacht Black Mass: This to me is deliciously unholy! I get a liturgical smoke, the resins, and the sweetness from the marshmallows. 
Notes: smoked vanilla, frankincense, Peru balsam, labdanum, amber, vetiver, atlas cedarwood, patchouli, night musk, and scorched marshmallows.


Hexennacht Crowley: This is probably my sexiest scents I own. Both my partner and I use it and love using it for nights out/date nights. I think it‚Äôs the perfect unisex scent. On me, I get the black tea (I LOVE Caroline‚Äôs black tea note), as well as the bergamot. The tobacco and amber mix so well and the vanilla rounds it out to be the perfect spicy sweet black tea. 
Notes: black tea, bergamot, tobacco, vanilla, amber.

Alkemia Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure: this to me is overtly feminine. Sexy on the lighter more soft side. It‚Äôs powdery, sweet, and airy. On me I don‚Äôt get the Jasmine or the incense and smell more of the pralines, cashmere, orchid, and orris. 
Notes: An opulence of cashmere sensuously perfumed with rare Japanese boudoir incenses, luxurious caramel pralines, vanilla orchids, bergamot, orris root, candied lemon peel, and a splash of champagne.

Olympic Orchids Red Cattleya: this is also sexy on the more airy/feminine side. The initial opening is sweet and floral, and the dry down is powdery floral. It just feels pretty, so so pretty. 
Notes: citrus, peach, apricot, melon, hyacinth, gardenia, violets lilac, dark musk, exotic woods and vanilla. | I tend to feel sexiest in earthy or green scents!   
  
**Dandelion Butter by Clue perfumery** feels like rolling in the grass with my lover and when we come up for air we're covered in milky sap from the crushed dandelion stems. **(Pollen, dandelion greens, yellow dandelion, snapped stem, milky sap, salted butter, dandelion-stained chin)**

**Golden Hour by SAMAR** is like cozy afterglow when our bodies are warm and entwined and we're minutes from melting into a post-sex nap. **Spiced honey mead, roasted peaches, clotted cream, dried herbs, cedar, musk** | I haven‚Äôt really found the central ‚Äútheme‚Äù that makes a scent sexy to me but I definitely have some scents that have given me that impression!

**Cult of Dionysus** from Pierrot Perfumery (fresh figs, ripe and juicy pears, honey, red wine, honey mead) I raved about the sexiness of this scent in my other review, and that‚Äôs because of the warmth, depth, and sweetness of it. It feels really welcoming and sweet, but the depth from the wine and mead really brings it into the ‚Äúsexy‚Äù zone for me.¬†

**Wildwood** from Topanga Window (sumac, vanilla, birch) This scent is like a hot woodworker lol. It‚Äôs got some sweetness from the vanilla, but the birch itself also smells kind of sappy and sweet. It lingers really well on me too, and the way it fades the second day makes me feel really sexy.¬†

**Satyr** from Haus of Gloi (Italian blood orange, blackened vanilla) This scent is simple but it just WORKS for me. The blackened vanilla makes the orange smell almost spiced without being drowned in cinnamon and cloves. It stays on my skin forever too, I think the pumpkin butter form makes it cling really nicely to my skin AND makes my skin super soft which also makes me sexier imo. | My go to date night perfume is hands down **Pierrot's Vampyr** (*A true amber perfume, sweet and musky*) it's just slinky and seductive and I always feel sexy wearing it. Also from Pierrot is **Heirophilia** (*An absolutely hedonistic blend of frankincense, myrrh, lit incense, and sex*) if you're looking for a mood to match that confessional scene in Fleabag. **Solstice Scents Conjure** (*A Magical Blend of Vanilla, Amber, Cedar, Spices & Cauldron Smoke*) is a great sassy witch scent, one of my only witchy scents without gourmand notes which, I agree, aren't sexy. On the off chance I'm looking for something more traditionally feminine smelling, I might reach for **SSE Yennifer Bold** (*Purple Lilac, Gooseberries, Black Suede, Ancient Woods*) or **Wyld Ivy's Rogue & Siren** (*Smokey and scandalous and utterly irresistible. Wood smoke on the autumn breeze, smoldering charcoal, burnt vanilla, and a kiss of black honey*) I didn't find this one that sexy at first, kind of just nice in a pretty/smokey way, but it's really grown on me. | Apsara by Fantome. I just received a sample a few weeks ago but will definitely be FSing as it's quickly become my favorite. I'm always a sucker for fig, the hibiscus is so pretty, and the patchouli here gives me very sexy bohemian. It makes me feel like I'm in my element - sexy, playful, freespirited 

*Juicy black figs and hibiscus nectar are at the heart of this luscious, syrupy fragrance tempered by smooth patchouli, iris, resinous woods, aged frankincense, benzoin, and spices.* | I feel so sexy when I wear my sample of Poesie‚Äôs *Eat Me* (peach lavender cake with marshmallow frosting and currants.)

Part of it‚Äôs the name (lol), but honestly, most of the sexy feeling comes from the scent itself. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of fruity and sweet and with a just a touch of bite from the lavender. Despite being a cake scent, I wouldn‚Äôt really describe it as gourmand. 

Unfortunately, I only have a sample, and they don‚Äôt sell it anymore! I‚Äôm hoping they reopen/offee their Alice in Wonderland collection at some point so that I can pick it up! | I love all these questions!¬†


I am a big fan of a vanilla musk that isn't too gourmand to feel most me. I love NAVA Crystalline Musk (really any with Crystalline) and Vanilla Musk. I think they tend to amplify a natural skin scent with a little something extra. My husband loves those ones as well and I think I've somehow tricked him into being addicted to their Strawberries and Cream Musk. I had to grab a backup recently! I don't think I own any more traditional sexy smelling scents but I feel most confident in myself when my perfume matches my vibe for the day and those ones sort of always lead to feeling a bit more feminine and put together.¬†


I also think that Sorce Falling Stars Vanilla Sweet Cream is more gourmand than the other vanillas but it's very intoxicating. I love to wear that one.¬† | I think sexy scents need a musk note, fruit and flowers just won't cut it. I like **Judith** by Treading Water | Howl and Mistress of Power by Possets, Smut by BPAL. | I would have to say Serpentine by Sorce. Although I don‚Äôt know that many would agree. I generally dislike darker scents that are typically considered sex. Red musk is a deal breaker for me. I wish I liked it, but I just don‚Äôt. | I discovered BPAL when one of my friends raved that they ""just bought the HORNIEST perfumes!""  I have a strong affinity for them to this day for that reason.  I love their horny perfumes!

Something complex that's a little smoky and a little sweet seems to be the skeleton formula to me.  Perversion remains my favourite - leather and booze with some smoke and sweetness, and of course the name.

The Dark Chocolate Rider and Red Lantern fit that bill pretty closely too, albeit much more foody with rich dessert scents mixed in.  Not such a bad thing to taste like a treat though.

I got Dahlia recently and have only tried it once so far, but I really like it and think it fits this formula too, with orchid and cardamom as the differentiators.

Aroused Demon is another favourite.  If not for the name, I don't know if I'd think of it as a scent that's supposed to be sexy, it's just filled with scents that I really like a lot.  But I also love it for the name.

Of the seemingly much more popular horny perfumes, both Smut and Debauchery are really, really good musks (and names), but to me they are like only wearing base notes and should be layered with other interesting scents.  Now that this question has me thinking about it, I should experiment with combining them with semi-sweet and spiced perfumes...  I have tried Lust and Smut together, and that was a good combo.  I got Lust for the name alone, and I don't recall liking the scent that much at first (I'm not a big patchouli fan), but it's now aged 3.5 years and it smells great, like nothing I remember trying. | I love reading my how different people‚Äôs sexy scents are! In general I find sensual resins and cashmere, to be notes I feel sexy wearing. 

For ‚Äògoing out sexy‚Äô:
Alkemia Amour de Ambre - A passionate love song of honeyed Madagascar vanilla, white orchids, bay rum, Mysore sandalwood, and six of our finest Arabian ambers exquisitely aged in charred cedar. Both as simple and as complex as the love of a thousand hearts.
(It‚Äôs so warm and beautiful!)

Alkemia Cherries of the Night - Black cherries, Maraschino liqueur, Cherry amber, Black amber, Spiced rum, Peru balsam. 
(If I could only pick one sexy scent, it would be this one!)

‚ÄòEveryday sexy‚Äô:
Death and Floral The Sweater we Buried You With is Hanging in My Closet -  a lush blend of three different vanillas, resinous ambers, Arabian sandalwood and soft cashmere sweater. 

Poesie Habibi - cardamom, amber honey in the comb, cinnamon + ginger, an opulent amber blended of precious resins and dark vanilla, henna flower, sandalwood incense

Alkemia Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure - An opulence of cashmere sensuously perfumed with rare Japanese boudoir incenses, luxurious caramel pralines, vanilla orchids, bergamot, orris root, candied lemon peel, and a splash of champagne. 
(I think the name contributes lol)

Sorce Between The Sheets: Figs, cream, beeswax absolute, cashmere, wool, skin musk                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Sorce UFO Disco: Mango lassi sprinkled with cardamom, guava, amyris wood and a holographic vanilla musk

Arcana Underwater Cities- An opening of our hand-extracted rosemary oil, sweet anise, and pure beeswax absolute leads to a heart of salt-encrusted Ambroxan, slanting sunbeams, sheer cedarwood, French seaweed absolute, and a touch of coastal wildflowers.
(This is something of a wild card but the earthiness and saltiness are funky-sexy!) | I also like that kind of scent, so here are ones I‚Äôve noticed:

I‚Äôd recommend trying one/some of BPALS serpents- Serpent in the Roses would be a good place to start, but Serpent in the Carnations (carnation, snake oil, clove) would also be a good one to try. Blood Kiss (Lush, creamy vanilla and the honey of the sweetest kiss smeared with the vital throb of husky clove, swollen red cherries, but darkened with the vampiric sensuality of vetiver, soporific poppy and blood red wine, and a skin-light pulse of feral musk), and Romans 13:8 (Almond, wild fig, red rose petals, cardamom, and oudh) would also be good options. 

Of those BPALs, I‚Äôve tried Blood Kiss (didn‚Äôt care for it, too much vetiver) and both Serpents. I really like Serpent in the Carnations but I thought it was too strong to wear to work and then it was gone from the Luper event. But I imagine it will be back next year. 

From Alkemia, maybe look at [Hell Courtisan](https://alkemiaperfumes.com/products/hell-courtisan?_pos=8&_sid=0ca583c30&_ss=r) (why is it spelled that way?), Venym (A dark sensuality of black roses, saffron infused oud, neroli, bergamot, star jasmine, black vanilla, limoo amani, Darjeeling tea, dark aged patchouli, ebony wood, opium, and black amber), and Dark Goddess. I like Dark Goddess but the civet kind of bothers me, I do not like Venym, and have not tried the first one but it looks like a good fit. | You might want to try BPAL's Harlot, it's sultry rose with cinnamon.  And of course it's just as good for the name. | Maybe Pacifica Sandalwood solid perfume? I wore that ages ago and remember it being earthy and spicy but also fresher than most sandalwoods I've come across if somewhat simple.",2025-09-23 08:57:32

I used to be a barista during high school and a few years during college so I still have some muscle memory when it comes to making coffee (or at least I hope so haha). 

Ther...",20,1758607511,"That‚Äôs a beautiful yellow! Congrats.

I have been using the GCP since 2021, and decide to mod it a year later with PID. Gagguino was probably too new or not there then.

So, here‚Äôs my personal opinion on what changed the quality or improved the flow most:

- IMS filter: 7/10 (this had a learning curve, but I tend to believe it gets me better extraction and flavours)
- Fixed pressure tamper: 7/10
- PID: 9/10 (allows me to try various roasts, and back to back good shots when friends come over)
- Single-hole steam cap: 6/10 (increases the force and makes it easier to create the vortex)
- Low-profile drip tray: 7/10 (allows me to keep larger cups - I don‚Äôt need to transfer my shots)
- WDT: 5/10 (flavor change not that noticeable; but sometimes it helps when static is higher to remove clumps)

I‚Äôm tempted to upgrade to these 2 things next (if I ever do!):
- Gagguino
- Steam knob handle | I think that moving needle tool is an overkill. Yeah it's fancy but it's not better if you do proper WDT with plain needle tool from Temu. Aldo I would recommend removing few needles (having less needles makes it actually do proper distribution instead of just moving coffee around the basket) and maybe swapping them with 0.25mm ones (also can be purchased on Temu cheaply).

Shaker is cool, but it's another thing in the workflow and for me, it's either blind shaker or WDT, not both of them.

I like self-leveling tamper simply because it's almost idiot proof. I say almost because they can also have slight angle if you're careless (although mine is from Temu haha). But I see bunch of people use Normcore, which does look a bit better (more expensive as well).

I haven't tried, but not once that I red IMS (or other) shower screen upgrades are not worth it. Meaning yeah, they're a bit better, but there's no need to swap properly working original one. And since it's wearable item, just wait until it's time for new one and then buy IMS.  
I hope that Pesado58.5 will launch their shower screen for GCP once I get to point of needing to change, they look awesome :)  
What I do think it's an upgrade is shower screen holder. GCP shoots water out of single hole and original shower screen holder just distributes it to 4 other holes and it's not doing it ideally. ShadesOfCoffee has a really good one and you can choose stainless steal or brass (I would do brass).

Just my 2 cents, I hope it helps a bit. | Thank you! The yellow was on sale ($388) and my GF liked the colour. I would have gone for the black one but it‚Äôs nice to have a pop of color in the kitchen. 

The low drip tray is essential for workflow. Got one from Etsy from a local guy who does 3D printing.  

PID has me intrigued. I might give it a shot. | How hard was it to Install pid/ installing gaggiuno? Seems daunting to me to be honest. It‚Äôs the only hesitation I have to buying a used gcp. Will I actually be able to mod it.

[1] both ppl in stateroom must purchase the same pkg (standard, plus, premier).  [2] your Plus / Premier is supposed to be canceled if caught sharing it with a non-paying person. [3] can only order 1 drink at a time. | Outside of the fact that yes, usually all adults in a single cabin have to buy it, they otherwise do care. However enforcment is basically impossible. I have gone on plenty of cruises on various lines where I had a group in multiple cabins and got drinks for others, just be discreet about it. If they catch you they can cancel your package and refuse you further drinks with no refunds. | If you only want WiFi and won't drink much, probably best to just buy the stand alone WiFi for one device ($25/day).¬† You can switch devices using the same login.¬† BTW free drip coffee is mostly good, except late in the day in the buffet. At dinner in the MDR is fine.¬† Continental breakfast is free with hang tag. That can include a carafe of coffee. | Can I add on a question? If we have two people in the cabin, both with Plus, and we want to order a meal in, can one person order both meals or do we order separately? | Thanks! First time cruising. I didn't pick up on that when it was showing me options in the app. Appreciate it! | This is correct. And you amy not get drinks of any kind for someone without package or paying  

While OP feels its 'feasible ' its this kind of theft and dishonesty that is changing rhe packages. | These are all things I didn't know. I didn't get as far as the fine print in the app. Much appreciated! | Yes, this all makes a lot of sense. Didn't realize you both had to buy the package (this is my first cruise). I read somewhere that people will get the package and then not worry if they want to get a drink for someone while at the bar. I probably took that out of context. Thanks for the clarification!",2025-09-23 08:57:32

I have never gotten tested to see if I have an allergy or sensitivity towards chromium and just avoided any exposure to the metal throughout my life.
