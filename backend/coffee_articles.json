    "content": "Weve been having a spirited debate here at the Sprudge offices over the past week. Not heated, but spirited. The question at the center doesnt require much in the way of an introduction. Its simply this: Who is on your specialty coffee Mount Rushmore? This is a roundabout way of asking, who are the four most influential figures of third wave coffee? Very little in the way of consensus has emerged from within Sprudges editorial mindsphere over the last week. In fact, the question itself raises questions unto itself. By what metric does one earn their spot as one of the four? And must it be the same metric for all? Do you privilege the old guard, whose impact has had more time to reach its potential? Or is it someone new, maybe someone with millions of surely-real and not remotely faux-bot followers across multiple social media platforms? And what the hell do you do with Howard Schultz? The answer may reveal more about when you started your own personal journey into the world of specialty coffee than anything, but still, it is a fascinating question worth considering. And so we want to hear from you. You can pop off on Sprudges Instagram and let us know your hot picks. You can contact us directly and make your case. Youre a real reader, not a botso make your authentic simulacra-free voice heard at long last! You want to put the barista who served your first natural processed Ethiopia that tasted like blueberries on the list? We wont say boo about it.

    "title": "Tea At The Top Of The World: A Visit To Indias Historic Wah Tea Estate",
    "content": "The arrival of the first flush is a highly anticipated moment at any tea estate. As I planned my visit to the Wah Tea Estate , I hoped to witness this moment first handto see the tender two leaves and a bud being plucked. Nestled in the picturesque Kangra Valley, at the foothills of the snow-capped Dhauladhar mountains in Himachal Pradesh, India, the estate promised a breathtaking backdrop to this seasonal ritual. But to my luck, or perhaps misfortune, I arrived just a little too early. The first flush had been delayed, a subtle but telling sign of the changing climate. The bushes were only beginning to stir, their fresh green tips just emerging, teasing me with the promise of what was to come. The Wah Tea Estate is the largest tea plantation in Palampur and the greater Kangra region, stretching across 526 acres. The estatehome to tea plantations, a tea factory, cafe, lodge, tea shop, and tasting roomcrafts Kangra Orthodox black and green teas, made exclusively from the original Camellia sinensis cultivar. I was warmly welcomed at the Lodge at Wah by Surya Jai Prakash, the fourth-generation planter who manages the estates operations, and his family. Envisioned by his father, Deepak Prakash, the Lodge exudes an understated sense of luxury, thoughtfully crafted with locally sourced materials and traditional techniques that honor the regions architectural aesthetic. Set within the workings of Wah, both the Lodge and the Estate offer guests multiple opportunities to immerse themselves in the art of tea-making. Guided tea tours and tasting sessions showcase a variety of estate-grown brews, offering a deeper appreciation of Kangras rich and often overlooked tea heritage. The heritage is complex and its legacy spans across the Himalayas, from Assam in the northeast to Kangra in the north. By the 1800s, Britains global empire was faced with the challenge of supplying tea to the obsessive tea-drinking population back home. Tea had long been grown in the hills of Assam, located in northeastern India at the foothills of Himalayas, many years before the British set foot in the region. However, the Empire brought its own desire and expertise (including those hired in from China) for growing the crop in Assam. As part of another effort to cultivate and secure a stable tea supply, a Scottish botanist named Robert Fortune, was dispatched on a secret mission to China to smuggle out tea plants along with the closely guarded knowledge of tea production. This Chinese varietal was cultivated in Himalayan valleys of Nepal: Darjeeling, Dehradun and Kangra. As part of this expansion effort, the British established the Wah Tea Estate in 1857 in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh. The estate thrived through decades of continuous cultivation and even withstood a devastating earthquake in 1905. It was later acquired by Sir Sikander Hayat-Khan, son of the Nawab of Wah in present-day Pakistan, who named the estate after his birthplace. Fittingly, Wah translates to wow, a sentiment visitors are likely to share upon experiencing the estate. The estate was bought in 1953 by the great grandfather of Surya Jai Prakash, who now oversees the manufacturing process at the estate and the affairs of the lodge. Hailing from a family of tea growers, Surya grew up immersed in the world of tea. The lush green bushes of the estate and the inviting warmth of the lodge reflect his dedication to crafting the perfect cup and creating an experience that truly embodies the journey from garden to cup. Tea estates in India are renowned for their black teas, crafted using the orthodox method, where each batch of freshly plucked leaves undergoes withering, rolling, and oxidation, carefully guided by a tea master to bring out the teas rich and complex flavors. While black tea production in the Kangra valley follows the same orthodox method, its flavor profile sets it apart from typical Assam and Darjeeling teas, featuring mild sweetness and a hint of pungency. In addition to manufacturing black teas, Wah has also been successful in blending the precision of Chinese tea tradition with the rich and diverse terroir of India. They have mastered the art of making pan-fired green, oolong and white teas. My company, Dona, sources its oolong and white teas from the Wah Tea Estate, and during my visit, I was eager to gain a deeper understanding of how both small batch teas are produced. During a guided tour of the factory, I met Wahs tea maker, Rudra Sharma who shared compelling insights into how true tea making begins not in the factory, but the tea garden. He brings with him three decades of experience from Darjeeling, now channeled into crafting a distinctive, darker oolong in the Kangra Valley that is smoky, pungent, and full of character. A master of his craft, he meticulously tracks the local weather conditionstemperature, humidity, and rainfallto determine the precise moment to halt oxidation by roasting the leaves over low heat. The oolong is hand rolled to ensure that the leaf is carefully treated and only made in small batches. The first tender leaves of the seasons flush are reserved for crafting white tea. Wahs white tea is something specialdelicate, nuanced, and with a taste that evokes the freshness of rain. The tea undergoes minimal processing, allowing the leaves to retain their subtle flavors and aromas. While walking through the tea estate, I noticed a few workers spraying the fields and initially assumed it was a conventional pesticide. Curious, I asked what they were using and was pleasantly surprised to learn it was a natural blend made from lemongrass and galgal (a citrus native to the Himalayas) both of which are cultivated alongside the tea. This eco-friendly practice is part of the estates transition to organic farming, which began two years ago. I also discovered that the soil is enriched with in-house biochar, produced from pruned tea bush wood at the end of each season, further supporting the estates commitment to sustainable cultivation. As the full range of Wahs teas was laid out before me for tasting, I was impressed by the mastery behind each cup. The estates deep respect for the leaf is evident in their carefully crafted brews. To my delight, I learned that the taste of oolong can be tailored to suit the preferences of Dona and its customers. It was encouraging to see how Wah thoughtfully brings together local traditions and the craft of tea-making. I left the estate with plenty of tea and a quiet hope to return someday and witness the energy of a full flush firsthand.

    "content": "The world is two things right now. It is a shitty and terrifying place that only seems to be getting worse. And it is also deeply in love with 90s nostalgia. And so, to use one to temporarily allay the reality of the other, we bring you news today of Central Perk , the fictional coffee shop from the era-defining multi-cam sitcom Friends, which is now a permanent brick-and-mortar in New York City. The Central Perk has already seeped into the real world on various occasions, mostly as temporary cafes in the pre-COVID times, when themed pop-ups were all the rage (see: the Gilmore Girls-inspired Lukes Diner pop-ups ). There is even a permanent installation in Boston, but this is the first location in NYC, which means its the first real location. As reported by Variety , the Central Perk will be on the northeast corner of 7 th Avenue and 47 th Street, in Times Square. It will made to look like the namesake coffee shop from the show, which is to say, a cozy 90s style coffee house. It will also include a replica of the orange couch that the cast spent an ungodly amount of time on despite supposedly having jobs. But because this is also an experience there will be meta-show things like themed blends and merchandise available for purchase. There will also be Friends-inspired food items available, that have been guided by restauranteur and Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio. Now, what Friends-inspired fare means who can say. Im racking my Friends episode rolodex for any food mentions and the best Im coming up with is the time Ross dressed up as a potato in outer space, or Spudnik, that others referred to as space doody. Or there was the time Joey only ate the skin of the fried chicken, leaving the meat up for grabs. The NYC Central Perk officially opens in the fall, which should give you more than enough time to bone up on your Friends quotes to casually drop while waiting for your coffee, that will be served but for some reason not made in a Chemex. So if you want to put your head in the sand for a little while and cozy up to the warmth of nostalgia, youd be forgiven for schlepping your way to Times Square to enjoy a bit of non-reality.

    "title": "The Price Of Arabica Coffee Futures Is Spiking",
    "content": "Since February, when the price of Arabica coffee futures on the commodities market reached an all-time high (not including inflation), there has been a bit of a downward trend. As recently as July, the price has dipped back down to 2.76. Then August hit, and coffee futures are once again nearing their peak price. Prices reached 4.17 on Monday , just .08 shy of the all-time high in February. The uptick, as anyone paying remote attention to global affairs can attest, is due primarily to the American tariff on Brazil. The 50 tax on all imported goods from Brazil, including coffee, took effect August 1 st , and the price has only gone up since then. In just a month and a half, it has increased by nearly 50, which represents one of the most significant jumps in history over that short of a timeframe. Still there are other factors working in concert with the tariffs to push prices higher. Per Barchart , a lack of rain in Brazilian coffee growing regions ahead of the critical flowering period for coffee trees is causing prices to spike. Meanwhile the Brazilian real is at a 15-month high against the dollar, which further discourages producers from exporting coffee. Adding to all this is the fact that International Commodity Exchange inventories of Arabica are at a 16-month low. But the main concern is the tariffs, and there appears to be no end in sight. Many American coffee buyers are cancelling contracts with Brazilian producers in favor of other countries with smaller tariffs. The current administration has expressed that commodities not grown domestically, like coffee, could be exempt from tariffs, but only after the producing country has signed a trade deal. And given that many believe the Brazilian tariffs are more politically motivated than fiscallyBrazil is one of the few countries for which America has a trade surplusthe actual end of the 50 tax on coffee from the largest exporter to the US isnt quite as clear cut.

    "title": "Build-Outs Of Coffee: Scenery In London, England",
    "content": "Its always exciting to check in on the London coffee scene, which has long been one of the worlds best. Todays Build-Outs of Coffee feature takes us south of the river, but not far south, where a multi-disciplinary rehearsal space complex called Jerwood Space is home to a lovely new coffee bar. This is Scenery , honorees at the 16th Annual Sprudgie Awards for Best DesignPackaging and one to watch in London for many years to come. The 2025 Build-Outs of Coffee is sponsored by Pacific Barista Series , La Marzocco , Ceado , and Dona. As told to Sprudge by Alex Wallace. For those who arent familiar, will you tell us about your company? We started Scenery having all worked in specialty roasteries before, with the intention of sourcing, roasting and talking about coffee in our own way. We really disliked the pretentious urge to educate and overwhelm people who might not know that much about coffee, where access to tasty stuff is gatekept away. We instead wanted to focus on making it funmaking it a choice how much people engage and providing as much detail as people wanted. Can you tell us a bit about the new space? Were in an incredible locationwere attached to the Jerwood Space, which is rehearsal spaces for the performing arts. The space itself is built out of an old Victorian eta school building, and is steeped in history. We have actors and production companies in preparing for their next stage debut mingling with residents, commuters and coffee loversproviding a proper third space. We have a full kitchen and plenty of seating (including a glasshouse full of tropical plants), and have the roastery on siteone of the most central London roasteries in full operation. Whats your approach to coffee? Weve established a niche in the last two years roasting very light (on a Loring S35 ) when compared to the typical UK market, working with great import partners and having a broad church style to our offer. We dont want to be exclusionary and believe deeply in respecting both sides of the supply chain equally. We source coffee seasonally, working as far upstream as possiblepre-contractingcontracting at harvest and working six months ahead, ensuring we have a balanced offer from impact project daily drinkers to the fun and unique absolute belters. Any machines, coffees, special equipment lined up? We use a Mavam undercounter two-group (with unibasketsturbo style shots), with Mahlkönig E80 GBW for house espresso and a Weber EG1 for single dose shots. We use a Poursteady for a wide and constantly changing autobrew menu, offering six to seven coffees from the offer at a time for either filter or espresso on top of the house coffees. Weve recently installed an optical sorter in the roastery, and are very excited to see how that improves the quality output How is your project considering sustainability? 100 of the furniture onsite is upcycled, and we tried to take a minimal intervention approach to materials when building the location. By having the roastery on site, all coffee served in the cafe is from reusable buckets and containers, and we have solid partners for waste stream recycling. Our pour-overs are served on trays made from 100 recycled plastics, made in the UK. We additionally conduct all last mile deliveries inside London in an electric van, delivering house coffee in reusable buckets that are collected. Another exciting initiativeweve engaged in dialogue with a company that takes jute coffee sacks and recycles them into insulation, and are eagerly collecting our first pallet of bags for conversion. Whats your hopeful target opening datemonth? We opened the dine in sections in March of this year, while we havent declared the site fully grand opened (its been a continual WIP) that is the closest we have come to some form of official opening. Are you working with craftspeople, architects, andor creatives that youd like to mention? We work with an amazing artist called Lucas Garcia to create the illustrations for each coffeethese designs acting as sub brands for each individual farm or producer, allowing a visual language that helps popularize their coffee for each returning season. These designs are based on both the landscape and geography of the region in which the farm is located (the tropical scenery) but also based on the flavor colors and even style of the coffeeheavy naturals might be dense designs, a lighter ethereal Gesha will be more open and airy. These designs are what got us Best Design Honouree in the 16th Annual Sprudgies and its entirely down to the collab with Lucas. Thank you! No, THANK YOU!

    "title": "Little Waves Launches Curious, a New Collaborative Coffee Menu",
    "content": "In the face of an increasingly divisive world, this series of drinks brings together coffee professionals from every continentand each beverage tells a powerful story of its own. BY CAROLINE CORMIER FOR BARISTA MAGAZINE Photos by Laura Vied Allen for Little Waves Coffee In a world too often defined by division, Durham, N.C.-based roastery Little Waves Coffee and its local retail shops, Cocoa Cinnamon , have launched Curious a menu that extends beyond the basics. The aim is to invite customers to explore specialty drinks designed to delight and surprise while also celebrating coffees remarkable ability to bridge divides across cultures and continents. Curious emerged from a moment of global tension in mid-2024. As Little Waves Coffee s owners observed the divisiveness sweeping across society, they envisioned a different path forward. We were thinking about observing loved ones shrinking worlds, witnessing violence begotten by absolutist patterns of thinking, our upcoming election, recalls Leon Grodski Barrera , who co-owns Little Wave Coffee Roasters with his wife and business partner, Areli Barrera de Grodski . These reflections coincided with a series of international trips and collaborations that showcased coffees power to connect people. The contrast between growing global divisions and coffees unifying potential sparked the creation of their innovative menu concept. Its hard to hate if youre curious. Its harder to be lonely if you are looking out into the world, asking questions and reaching out to others, reads the projects website. This sentiment sits at the core of Curious, a collection of beverages that embodies the transformative experience of stepping into new landscapes and perspectives, bringing together a group of 12 coffee professionals from every continent to curate a menu that represents a sense of shared humanity using the language of coffee as its basis. The Handshake, created with Lisa Yang and Matthew Yu of BerryBird Coffee , features house-made lychee syrup with lemon juice over chilled espresso. Creating a Community of Practice To get started, Little Waves reached across their network, engaging with some coffee professionals theyve known for decades and others they had never met in person. Connecting virtually, participants came together to share their experiences and knowledge with the express aim of devising drinks that would eventually make their way to customers, both in Durham at the three Cocoa Cinnamon locations, as well as at coffee shops on every continent. What makes this collaboration particularly remarkable is its truly global scope. Curious represents a deliberate shift from coffees traditional power dynamics, creating a space where knowledge and creativity flow multi-directionally. By bringing together experts from every continent as equal contributors, the menu celebrates the richness that emerges when diverse approaches to coffee are given room to inspire one another. Exploring Local Tastes Each drink on the Curious menu represents more than just flavorsit embodies personal stories, local histories, cultural traditions, and the creative spark that ignites when different perspectives converge. From traditional preparation methods passed down through generations to innovative techniques born from cross-cultural exchange, the menu reads like a passport of coffee experiences. Though each creation has its own distinct identity, they all share a common thread: the spirit of curiosity that inspired their creation. These arent simply beverages; theyre invitations to step outside familiar territory and experience coffee through someone elses perspective. The collaborative process wasnt without challenges. Besides coordinating schedules across different time zones, the bigger challenge was translating local ingredients into reproducible recipes, which required patience and genuine openness from all involved. As Melissa Ibarra, who heads up the flagship location of Cocoa Cinnamon and was the flavor lead on this project, explains, For me, the challenging part was finding the ingredients that are not originally from the U.S. and being able to create the drink without tasting the original one first. I was certain that having the original items would make it taste so different, so it was complicated to know if I even got close to the same taste. ESPRESSO  strangers, developed with Deandra Gauci from Malta, is an espresso tonic infused with house-made Sri Lankan cinnamon syrup and garnished with rosemary and dried orange. Yet it was precisely these challenges that yielded the projects most profound rewardsmoments of connection that transcended the coffee itself. In fact, rather than focus on what was lost in translation, the collective focused on what was gained. Many of us discussed that ingredients are different in different places, and that would affect iterations as each or any of us presented the drinks at our shops in North Carolina or at theirs in their countries, says Leon. This philosophy of celebrating local variations became central to the projects identity, with Melissa expertly adapting concepts while honoring collaborators input, and the talented Lauren Vied Allen capturing their essence visually. For Melissa, this collaboration was a fantastic learning opportunity. It was so fascinating to see what others serve in their coffee shops across the world, and what it means to them, says Melissa. It was a great reminder that coffee can be presented in so many ways, and have different meanings, flavors, and connections. The Drinks One cannot fully appreciate the Curious menu without understanding the stories behind each creation. While the drinks might be enjoyed purely for their sensory pleasures, knowing the narrative behind each recipe adds dimensions of meaning that transform the experience from consumption to connection. Take, for example, Until the End of the World, created with Emmanuel Rusatira and Smayah Uwajeneza, both from Rwanda , and Dr. Jane Dell, who works in Antarctica. The drink incorporates a frozen cardamom-infused ice sphere melting into a single-origin Rwanda Ikizere womens lot pourover concentrate, referencing the retreating glaciers of Antarctica and the warming of our planet. This marriage of Rwandan coffees sweet brown spice notes with cardamom showcases Rwandas flavors, while Dr. Dells inspiration stems from her experience fostering a sense of community over coffee in the isolation of Antarctica. When customers order this drink, theyre not just tasting coffee; theyre engaging in a dialogue about climate change , global collaboration, and the unique flavors of Rwanda. Until the End of the World, a drink created by Emmanuel Rusatira and Smayah Uwajeneza, both from Rwanda, and Dr. Jane Dell, from Antarctica. Featuring single-origin Rwandan coffee and a cardamom-infused ice sphere, the drink showcases Rwandas flavors while serving as a metaphor for climate change. This drink has already proven its popularity in Durham, with customers appreciating how the melting cardamom ice cube gradually transforms the flavor profile. The Cocoa Cinnamon team regularly encourages patrons to enjoy it outside on the patio, prompting them to take a moment to slow down and mindfully observe how the taste and texture evolve over time, a subtle yet powerful metaphor for our changing world. Similarly, ESPRESSO  strangersdeveloped with Deandra Gauci from Maltademonstrates how coffee can serve as a vehicle for preserving and sharing cultural heritage while simultaneously evolving through creative collaboration. This drink uses a house-made Sri Lankan cinnamon syrup with espresso tonic, garnished with rosemary and dried orange, creating a multi-sensory experience. The rosemary influences the aroma while the orange subtly infuses the drink, mirroring the Maltese cultures blend of Italian, Arabic, French, and English influences. Finally, Aristotle Dream Popconceptualized with Dot Mediano from Davao City, Philippines pushes the boundaries of coffee innovation by blending aesthetics, flavor, and philosophy. This vibrant drink layers strawberry jam, milk soda, ube whipped cream, and blue ternate infusion, topped with black lava salt and paired with co-fermented espresso on the side. Dots process, inspired by Aristotles formula for beauty and sensorial harmony, reflects the volcanic origins of coffee, with colorful layers symbolizing the contrast between natures raw power and creative artistry. Because of its visually striking appearance, it has quickly become a customer favorite in Durham. Aristotle Dream Pop, a drink created with Dot Mediano from Davao City, Philippines, layers strawberry jam, milk soda, ube whipped cream, and blue ternate infusion, topped with black lava salt and paired with co-fermented espresso on the side. The drinks mentioned above are just a small sample of what the Curious menu has to offer. As a whole, the menuwith its emphasis on ice and citrusnot only suits warmer weather but also highlights how coffee can become a vessel for preserving and sharing local knowledge and ingredients, all while evolving through creative collaboration and the joy of a well-crafted flavor journey. Beyond the Cup What makes Curious particularly significant is its timing. In a moment when many forces push toward isolation and fear of difference, this menu extends an invitation to look outward with openness. Each drink serves as a small ambassador for its creators corner of the world, offering customers a taste that dissolves boundaries, allowing flavors to tell stories that resonate across cultures, experiences, and even places. The team at Little Waves Coffee and Cocoa Cinnamon has thoughtfully extended the café experience beyond the physical menu. Detailed stories about each drink and its creator can be found via a QR code in the shop as well as on their website, allowing customers to indulge their curiosity and deepen their connection to these global coffee narratives. For the team in Durham, Curious represents more than just a successful menu launch. It embodies their commitment to coffee as a force for connection in a fragmented world. By creating space for diverse voices and inviting customers to engage with unfamiliar stories, theyve demonstrated how a local coffee shop can participate in global dialogue. With the simple act of ordering a drink from the Curious menu, customers become participants in this dialogue. They taste expressions of both near and distant places, encounter new flavors and traditions, and perhaps find themselves developing their own curiosity about the wider (coffee) world and the people who inhabit it.

    "title": "SANA Mental Health Initiative Ushers in a New Era for Women Coffee Producers",
    "content": "Launched by Colombian photographer Lucia Bawot, the bold program seeks to bolster the mental and emotional well-being of women at origin. BY VASILEIA FANARIOTI SENIOR ONLINE CORRESPONDENT Photos courtesy of Lucia Bawot In the heart of Colombia s coffee-growing regions, a quiet but powerful movement is reshaping the conversation around sustainability in coffee. Its not about new equipment or climate-resilient varietals, but something far more human: emotional well-being. Meet SANA , a pioneering mental health initiative founded by Colombian photographer and storyteller Lucia Bawot, and championed across borders by Diana Ayala Gómez of International Womens Coffee Alliance (IWCA) Spain . Designed specifically for women in coffee farming communities, SANA addresses one of the industrys most neglected issues: the emotional toll of life and labor in the coffee supply chain. A Legacy Beyond the Lens Lucias path to founding SANA began behind the camera. For over a decade, she traveled across Latin America, documenting sustainability stories for major coffee companies. But it was during the creation of her debut book, We Belong: An Anthology of Colombian Women Coffee Farmers, that something shifted. The booknow award-winning and internationally exhibitedfeatures portraits and vignettes from 25 women coffee producers. But as Lucia conducted interviews, she noticed the conversations going deeper than expected. What began as interviews often turned into emotional releases, she says. These women needed more than visibilitythey needed spaces to heal. What started out as a photography project by a Colombian artist eventually evolved into SANA: a mental health initiative designed to empower women coffee producers. Moved by these encounters and her own experiences with mental health, Lucia launched a pilot program in 2023 called Beans to Minds. Funded largely by proceeds from her book, the five-month program provided virtual therapy, education, and community support to 39 women in Colombia. The results were striking: 100 of participants said they felt heard, supported, and guided; 92 reported resolving personal or family challenges. Building on that success, Lucia formally launched SANAa scalable, integrative wellness initiative that she hopes will reach thousands. Mental health is at the heart of gender equity, Lucia says, and it must be part of the sustainability agenda for every coffee company. Mental health is at the heart of gender equity, says Lucia Bawot, founder of SANA. Inside the SANA Model SANA is structured around a culturally conscious five-month curriculum that includes teletherapy sessions, audio-visual education delivered via WhatsApp, and one in-person group workshop. With a maximum of 40 participants per cohort, the program is intentionally intimate and responsive. For many participants, SANA marks their first experience with any form of mental health support. Rather than clinical language, the program emphasizes emotional resilience, self-awareness, and agency. SANAs model is based on the salutogenic approach, prioritizing wellness, resilience, and purpose over pathology. We dont talk about diagnoses, Lucia explains. We talk about strengthening emotional capacity. Were creating spaces where women can reconnect with themselvesand each other. The decision to deliver support virtually was both logistical and philosophical. Mental health resources are scarce in rural Colombia, and stigma often prevents women from seeking help. By offering services remotely and privately, SANA lowers the barriers to entry and respects the rhythms of the womens daily lives. Weve found that therapy by phone or video actually makes it easier for many women to open up, Lucia says. They can do it in their own space, on their own terms. Carmen shares her experience with SANAs mental health program. Breaking the Silence, Together For Diana Ayala Gómez, co-founder of IWCA Spain, Lucias vision struck a deeply personal chord. When I heard the voices of the women in (Lucias book) We Belong, I felt seen, Diana recalls. It reminded me how rarely we talk about the emotional realities of women in coffee . With over a decade of experience across the value chain, Diana has witnessed firsthand how emotional labor often goes unrecognizedespecially in roles traditionally occupied by women. A recent MBA program deepened her understanding of the systemic nature of gender inequities and emotional isolation in the coffee sector. Through IWCA Spain, Diana helped amplify SANAs message, connecting it to broader international conversations. This isnt just Lucias projectits becoming a shared mission, she says. Were creating bridges between producing communities and the global coffee world. And the resonance is growing. IWCA chapters in Greece and beyond have voiced strong support, and a multilingual webinar is underway to bring the conversation to a wider audience. Mental health isnt a luxury, Diana adds. Its a necessity for resilience, dignity, and sustainability. In SANAs first cohort, 54 of households were led by women, demonstrating how central these women are to their communities. The Stories Behind the Numbers SANAs impact is best understood through the voices of the women themselves. One participant describes how therapy helped her release repressed sadness and reconnect with her family. Another shares how unprocessed stress was affecting her physical health. These sessions came at the perfect time, she explains. They were truly healing. The women support each other through dedicated WhatsApp groups, forming micro-communities of trust and solidarity. For many, the experience is transformative not just personally, but socially. They emerge not just as healthier individualsbut as leaders within their families and communities. Whats Next In 2025, SANA aims to enroll 120 women in Colombia and expand to other Latin American countries in the years ahead. The organization is also exploring tailored mental health support programs for male producers. Our vision is that mental and emotional well-being become just as essential as physical health and economic stabilitythat they become part of how we measure sustainability in coffee, Lucia says. Virtual therapy isnt a compromiseits a lifeline: 85 of women interviewed by SANA said remote access made it easier to open up and stay involved. And for those looking to get involved, the invitation is clear. A one-time donation of 25 can sponsor a womans full participation in the program. Organizations can sponsor entire cohorts and receive detailed impact reports. Its more than likely the coffee you drank today was touched by the hands of a woman, Lucia says. Supporting her well-being is not charityits justice. To learn more or donate, visit SANAs website.

    "title": "The Ultimate Cost of Tariffs: Smallholder Coffee Farmers Are Paying the Price",
    "content": "Coffee shops across the U.S. are being negatively impacted by tariffsbut communities at origin are feeling the effects even more. BY HANH NGUYEN BARISTA MAGAZINE ONLINE Featured photo courtesy of Hanh Nguyen The current uncertainty around tariffs has the coffee industry swirling like a shot of espresso gone wrong: bitter, muddy, and hard to swallow. Tariffs on coffee imports take something that is already rare and make it more expensive. There are real economic considerations. Coffee shops across the country are facing tough choices, including raising prices to keep their doors open. But for me, this moment feels personal in a different way. I spent two years traveling to coffee-growing communities , not as a policy expert but as a filmmaker, listening and learning. So, when I think about these tariffs, I see the faces of the farmers and families I met in Nicaragua and Guatemala, and the roasters and baristas who take pride in the drinks they craft. I think about people: the people who could be hit hardest by decisions far from their control. A still from Caffeinated , a documentary that tells the stories of coffee-growing communities. Photo courtesy of Hanh Nguyen. When my co-director, Vishal Solanki, and I began making our film,  Caffeinated , we didnt set out to make it about economics or global policy. We just wanted to tell a story about the many hands that shape a cup of coffee. What we found along the way was a global network of growers, roasters, exporters, importers, café owners, and baristas. What Ive learned is that the United States imports 99 of the coffee Americans consumemostly from whats known as the Bean Belt, a stretch around the equator with ideal conditions for coffee to thrive. But it doesnt thrive on climate alone. It thrives because of people. And many of those people are already navigating climate change , price instability, and long-standing inequality. Adding tariffs to the mix doesnt just raise prices at the register; it adds pressure on lives already under strain. Ten percent base tariffs have been added to all coffee imports to the U.S., impacting both coffee shop owners and producers at origin. Photo by Paige Lane Elmer . Earlier this year, a 10 base tariff was issued on all U.S. coffee imports, with higher levies on key producers like Nicaragua, Indonesia, and my home country of Vietnam. The National Coffee Association began petitioning for exemptions, warning that these price hikes could devastate both small roasters and cafés, and ripple back through the entire supply chain. The courts have issued an injunction, but more action by the administration is likely brewing. Whats often missing from the conversation is the most personal part: the impact on the farmersreal people and their familieswho grow this beloved crop for our consumption. Coffee isnt just a beverage or a cropits the product of an immense amount of labor, from real people around the world. Photo by Elias Sorey . When we released Caffeinated, it was meant as a love letter to coffee, yes, but also as a mirror to the industrya way to see past the cup and into the lives that shape it. Ten years later, I find myself reflecting on whats changed, and what hasnt. Im no longer in the fields with the people who welcomed us into their lives, but from what I can see, the foundational imbalance remains. Farmers still take on the greatest risks and receive the smallest rewards. And now, they may have to bear the weight of policies they had no hand in creating. Yes, coffee is big business, but for those of us whove worked behind the bar or spent time in the field, we know its also something far more personal. Its ritual. Its culture. Its a way of life. And for many of the people I met, its survival. A still from the film Caffeinated , depicting the Perez family. Photo courtesy of Hanh Nguyen. Consider that, according to the IDH Sustainable Trade Initiative : Eighty percent of the worlds coffee is grown by 25 million smallholder farms 125 million people globally depend on coffee for their livelihoods For most producers, coffee makes up 70 to 90 of their household income These are not just numberstheyre lives, families, and communities that could be pushed to the brink by tariffs that increase costs across the entire supply chain. If we lose sight of the people who make up this supply chain, we lose more than good coffeewe lose a part of what makes this industry so special. I encourage you to reach out to your local elected officials to support the National Coffee Associations lobby for an exemption on coffee from any future tariffs. And if you havent seen  Caffeinated  in a while, it might be worth revisiting it with todays context in mind and as a gentle reminder of the people most affected by these tariffs. If youve never seen it, nows a good time. Maybe it will spark a conversation in your café, classroom, or community. Because behind every cup is a storya human storyand its one we shouldnt lose sight of.

    "title": "Meet the Coffee Businesses Fighting for a More Equitable Industry",
    "content": "In an effort to create more equality from farm to cup, these coffee shops and roasteries are putting farmers at the forefront of their work. BY JODEE FOK BARISTA MAGAZINE ONLINE Photos by Ariel Ngan Often dubbed the artistic capital of Thailand , Chiang Mai is renowned for its countless bustling artisan and handicraft markets. But scattered around the city is also a vast array of coffee shops offering uniquely homegrown specialty coffee. Upon walking thousands of steps around the old city (visiting all the must-see temples!), I felt a desperate need to get caffeinated and dragged my friend to a local coffee shop close by, Akha Ama Coffee . Stepping through the door, we were instantly greeted by bright sunlight pouring in, the lively chatter of dozens of coffee drinkers, and, of course, the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Waiting for a pourover at Chiang Mai, Thailands Akha Ama Coffee. To feed my coffee addiction, I couldnt wait to go through their pourover offerings and order a Sunda Gesha without much hesitation. The initial sip of it awakened my taste budsI was surprised by its balance of sweetness, acidity, and body with hints like stone fruit. This piqued my curiosity about its origin story. I learned that the coffee was cultivated by a farmer named Ader in a small Chiang Rai village, Maejantaiand my first instinct was to Google Ader. Ader is among the many smallholder coffee farmers supported by Akha Ama , a social enterprise coffee roastery and shop established by her elder brother, Lee Ayu Chuepa, in 2010. Having witnessed the innumerable financial and social hardships smallholder coffee-farming families faced when growing up in the Akha hill tribe, Lee was determined to make a difference through Akha Ama. The philosophy for Akha Ama isnt from myself alone; its from the community, says Lee in a Thailand NOW interview . A balanced cup of Sunda Gesha comes with a card explaining that the coffee was cultivated by a farmer named Ader. Akha Ama is quintessentially an advocate for direct trade, sourcing coffee beans directly and only from Lees village and other indigenous communities. This model bypasses traditional middlemen and fosters a direct and steady relationship between coffee growers and buyers, retaining more value for the former while mitigating trading uncertainties for both. In addition, the social enterprise trains farmers in agroforestry coffee cultivation an alternative to monoculture farmingthat intercrops coffee plants with shade trees. Hundreds of families have reaped the ecological benefits of this technique, such as improved biodiversity and soil health. Akha Ama is just one example of impact businesses emerging across the Global South that help coffee farmers, especially smallholders, break the cycle of poverty and unlock growth opportunities, not least in the face of rapid climate changewith adverse effects such as rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall that pose a threat to coffee production stability. Available data has shown that smallholder farmers constitute 60 of global coffee production, and yet, an estimated 5.5 million of them are living below the poverty line. Attributable to widespread poverty among these farmers could be the unequal revenue distribution in the global coffee value chain: Only around 10 of retail price ends up in farmers hands , and a sizable portion goes toward roasters and retailers. Beyond ensuring a fairer price for coffee farmers, purpose-driven businesses are stepping in to upskill and reskill them as well as transform the local value chain for good. One such instance is Spring Valley Coffee , a certified Kenyan B Corporation currently owned by Ritesh Doshi, who recalled in an STVP interview a troubling realization several weeks before he decided to acquire the business: A 18 bag of coffee sold in the United States, only 2 makes it back to a farmer in Kenya. Tormented by this disparity, he aspires to yield better returns for local farmers by addressing the long-standing conundrum that coffee sold in and from Kenya is predominantly green beans, which significantly hinders the potential for domestic coffee market growth. In realizing its vision of grown in Kenya, roasted in Kenya, available to the world, Spring Valley Coffee drives local value addition and offers farmers better prices for their crops. Bolstering the home marketas Spring Valley has opened multiple branches across Kenyaalso helps farmers navigate the volatility of green bean prices on the global market. The list of examples of impactful enterprises goes on: Guatemalas Buena Tierra acts as an intermediary that connects farmers with both local and overseas buyers, contributing to a 67 increase in their coffee prices ; Vietnams Detech Coffee enhances coffee farming, production, and processing capacities among ethnic minorities, with its Rainforest Alliance training program benefitting 500 smallholder farmers in Son La. Whether youre a casual coffee drinker or a dedicated aficionado, the power to uplift coffee-growing communities is in your hands. The strides these impact businesses have made to positively impact the lives of thousands of coffee farmers cant be emphasized enough. With evolving challenges such as the foreseeably increasing regulatory requirements imposed by the EU Deforestation Regulation, its time for uswhether casual coffee drinkers or dedicated aficionadosto strengthen support for these businesses in the hope of uplifting coffee-growing communities.

    "title": "How to make French press coffee",
    "content": "How to make French press coffee December 27, 2021 by Sarfraz Latif How to make French press coffee 5 2 votes Rating Jun 10, 2021 The French press has been extremely popular for almost a century because its easy to use and makes a super rich, full bodied coffee. Its a very gentle way of extracting flavor from coffee grounds with hot water, so all of our tips revolve around making sure enough coffee solubles get extracted for a sweet and balanced taste. Heres our French press brewing guide, along with some tips to make the most of your french press! WHAT YOU NEED 17 ounce French press MAKES 2 CUPS 35 grams or 5 tbsp medium coarse coffee 2.5 cups (17 oz or 500ml) water at 205F (3 minute off boil) Scale or measuring cup Spoon 34 ounce French press MAKES 4 CUPS 65 grams or 11 tbsp medium coarse coffee 4 cups (34 oz or 1000ml) water at 205F (3 minute off boil) Scale or measuring cup Spoon RECIPE 1 PRE-HEAT THE FRENCH PRESS Using hot water from your kettle or sink, fill the press to the top to pre-heat, and place plunger inside. This is especially helpful if you have a glass press. Remember to pour water out before continuing! 2 POUR COFFEE Add 35 grams of coffee for the 17 oz press, or 65 grams of coffee for the 34 oz press, shake until grounds lay evenly across the bottom. 3 BLOOM Set French press on scale and start your timer. Pour 20 of the hot water over the grounds (approximately 100 grams (or ml) or 3oz for the 17 oz press, 180 grams (ml) or 6 oz for the 34 oz press). Wait for 45 seconds. During the bloom, CO2 escapes from the coffee grounds, so we wait 45 seconds after the first pour to allow the gas to release before continuing, ensuring a balanced extraction. 4 STIR GROUNDS After 45 seconds, stir the coffee grounds with a spoon so they become evenly saturated (no dry pockets!) 5 POUR WATER Pour the rest of the water in. 6 PLUNGE Wait until 5 minutes and 30 seconds have passed since you first started your timer at the beginning of the brew, then plunge the press. Pour the coffee into your drinking vessels. The coffee will continue to brew if left inside the press, so pour all of it out into mugs or another container if you can. TIPS FOR BREWING TIP 01  USE FILTERED WATER Did you know that coffee is 98 water? The quality of the water you use to brew your coffee directly affects the taste in your cup! Just running your tap water through a filter like Brita or Pur will affect the taste of your coffee for the better. TIP 02  BURR GRINDER Coffee tastes best when ground right before you brew, and burr grinders give you a much more even grind size. When theyre very different, the water gets less from the big pieces (giving you sour flavors), and too much from the smaller pieces (bitter flavors). TIP 03  USE A SCALE Depending on varietal and where in the world theyre grown, beans weigh different amounts, and theyre also different sizes. Scooping to measure your coffee recipe becomes less and less reliable. The answer? Weigh your coffee on a gram scale to make sure you have the right recipe. TIP 04  TRY A BLOOM! When hot water hits dry coffee grounds for the first time, those grounds will bubble up and release a bunch of gas (mostly C02). While those gases are leaving, its hard for the water to actually pull out coffee flavor. So what to do? We wait! This is called the bloom time.

    "title": "HOW WE SET OUR MISSION: LEARNING AND EVOLVING",
    "content": "Our mission hasnt always been this way. Over the years, our mission has evolved because weve never stopped learning new things about the complex world of coffee and adapting our business along the way. Were incredibly proud of how weve embraced change and learned from our experiences and new knowledge. This journey has deepened our love for coffee and strengthened our commitment to doing things right: sustainably, inclusively, and transparently. Early Days (2014-2016) We (Anu and Suyog) started Driftaway Coffee in 2013 because we wanted to create something we would be proud of. After graduating from engineering school, we found ourselves working in marketing consulting and feeling unfulfilled with corporate life. Making coffee at home was something we had fallen in love with around the same time. So, we decided to start a coffee company combining these two passions. We began learning to roast coffee at home, designed our own packaging, and started Driftaway from our tiny one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. As we learned about how coffee traveled through many different hands, this realization inspired the name Driftaway . We wanted the name to acknowledge the journey coffee takes, hence Driftaway. We were intentional about putting the coffee producers at the center of the story behind the coffees, and we designed our labels to look like vintage baggage tags, a nod to the coffees journey to us. The first few years were spent getting off the ground without any outside investment (which we still dont have, to this day!) . We concentrated on roasting commercially, figuring out our sourcing, growing our customer base, and hiring our first employees. This hard work paid off, and we proudly became profitable in 2016. In order to gather coffee skills, we utilized resources from: Advanced Roasting Techniques, Boot Coffee, 2014 Classes, events and cuppings at Counter Culture Coffee Roasting training, Pulley Collective Focus on Sustainability and Farmer Prosperity (2017-2019) As we learned more about coffee, we became increasingly aware of the inequities in the coffee value chain. In 2017, we visited farms at origin (Costa Rica and Guatemala) for the first time with our importing partners, Cafe Imports. Producers asked us what we thought of their coffee, which made us realize how they never hear from consumers directly. This led to the creation of the Farmer Feedback Program where we send customer feedback directly to farmers. Hearing first-hand from producers about how their biggest issue was the uncertainty around coffee growing  drought, pests, and diseases  kicked off the Bean for Bean project, where we started donating 5 cents to the World Coffee Research (WCR) for every pound of coffee we roast. During this time, we also looked at the ecological impacts of our business. We vowed to remove plastic from our packaging by switching to compostable bags and aimed to become carbon neutral (by 2019) . Additionally, we signed the price transparency pledge by Transparency.coffee committed to complete transparency in our coffee sourcing, along with several other specialty coffee companies. With this, sustainability and farmer prosperity became core parts of Driftaways mission. Making Coffee Accessible  Fun (2020-2022) The years 2020 to 2022 brought an additional focus for Driftaway Coffee  making coffee accessible and fun. As the world adjusted to new ways of connecting during the COVID-19 pandemic , we saw an opportunity to bring the coffee tasting experience into peoples homes. We launched virtual tastings to help our customers learn more about coffee in an easy, non-intimidating way. Our goal was to make coffee accessible and enjoyable for everyone, breaking down barriers and inviting more people into the world of coffee . These virtual tastings allowed us to engage with our community in a whole new way. We could share stories about the origins of our coffee, the different flavors to look for, and how to taste coffee like a pro. It was a chance to bring our mission of making specialty coffee accessible, creating a deeper connection between our customers and the coffee they love. We believe that creating equity in the broader specialty coffee industry hinges on consumers asking for the things they care about, which is why we are committed to remaining an accessible and fun resource for all types of coffee drinkers. Equity  Inclusive Sourcing (2023 Onwards) In 2023, we were looking to start an origin-focused parallel entity in coffee that was a non-profit. To learn more, we dove deeper into the challenges faced at origin and work on projects that could help solve them. However, we realized we didnt know enough about these issues. To bridge this gap, we attended the Lets Talk Coffee conference organized by Sustainable Harvest in Copan Ruinas, Honduras. This conference was life-changing for us. It was a small, intimate gathering with around 350 attendees, 70 of whom were producers. The conference included lectures and discussions about myriad challenges faced by coffee producers, including gender inequity, economic instability, and environmental threats. Hearing directly from the producers about their struggles and needs gave us invaluable insights and a renewed sense of purpose. Instead of starting a new entity, we decided to build our learnings into the evolved mission and culture of Driftaway. We learned how women and minority farmers dont get as much support or as many resources. Women coffee farmers make up 70 of the workforce in coffee production yet systematically have lower access to resources like land, credit and just plain information. This realization led us to completely upend how we source coffee. Our current mission is to build an equitable value chain by prioritizing women and minority producers and making coffee accessible and fun for coffee consumers. We now purchase 50 of the coffees we roast from women farmers, and specifically seek out coffees from minority producers like Black Brazilian farmers and indigenous farmers, and work with exporters owned and operated by people from the country of origin , so that more of the value from the supply chain can be maintained in the origin country.

    "title": "Iced Coffee  Flash Brew",
    "content": "We use this recipe all summer long and it makes for a great summer of iced goodness. Brewing with hot water preserves a coffees acidity (aka the juiciness, brightness, fruit-like qualities) and complexity, and flash-cooling it preserves its sweetness. This method is especially great when you want iced coffee immediately, and cant wait for a cold brew to steep. Before we begin, its important to note that there are three different ways (at least, but these are the main ones!) of making cold coffee: 1. Iced Coffee - Regular Style: This is the simplest and unfortunately, the least tasty type of cold coffee. Its made by making an entire cup or pot of coffee using hot water, and then cooling it slowly in a fridge. The slower a coffee is cooled down from hot, the more bitterness it develops. 2. Cold Brew: Steeping coffee for 12 to 24 hours in cold or room temperature water. The resulting coffee has less acidity, but is also less dynamic. Cold brew takes many many hours (potentially overnight) brewing so a lot more planning is involved. 3. Flash Brew: Coffee is brewed with hot water and as it falls through the filter, it is immediately cooled and diluted by ice. Flash brew captures the brightness and acidity of a coffee by brewing with hot water, but its cooled down immediately, so it doesnt get those bitter flavors associated with the regular way of making iced coffee. Check out this very short video we made for more info! Flash Brew Tutorial When making flash brew, we are essentially making a concentrate. Well use about the same amount of coffee that we would if brewing a regular pour over, but 14 of the hot water will be replaced with ice. This kind of cold coffee can be made with all sorts of brewers: pour over, electric drip, or Aeropress, to name a few. For this tutorial, well use the pour over method. As with all coffee making, using a scale makes everything much easier. 1:15 ratio (1 part coffee, 15 parts water) We usually recommend 1:16 or 1:17 of coffee to water for a hot pour over or electric drip, but since we will add ice into the cup we drink it out of, which will dilute the brew even more, we aim for the concentration to be 1:15 after making it. But feel free to mess around and get that ratio perfect for your strength preference! Coffee: 47 grams (or 8 tablespoons) Grind slightly finer than what youd normally grind at for that brewer. Hot water: 710 ml (or 3 cups) Temperature between 205F  210F (or 1 to 3 min off boil). Higher temps for lighter roasts. Ice: 270g Put the ice in the server or carafe that youll be brewing into - if its an electric drip, the ice goes right into your coffee pot. Total brew time: 3:30 min Aim for all water to be done dripping through the filter at around 3 minutes, 30 seconds. Since youre using less water than usual, a finer grind and a slightly slower pour is recommended. STEP BY STEP 1. Setup your pour over equipment as usual, put that 270g of ice into the carafe and if using our recipe, 47 grams of coffee into a rinsed filter. 2. Start the timer and brew as you would normally brew a manual pour-over. 3. Use concentric circles when pouring hot water, and keep an eye on time and amount of water that has gone through. 4. Looks delicious, doesnt it? 5. Try to have all of your water poured by 2:45. It should take about 45 seconds to drip through. 6. There you have it. Some tips: Use smaller ice cubes and they will melt more quickly. If you have a lot of unmelted ice after brewing, stir it around a bit to melt. Next time, you could try using a little bit less ice (but remember to increase the amount of hot water to replace it, because that ice is part of the recipe!) Try a bright coffee - African coffees are great with this method, and some of Central Americans, too. Tags: coffee in summer iced coffee Japanese Cold BRew pourover recipe",

    "content": "Brew Guide for the Kalita Wave Pourover Cone March 10, 2022 by James McCarthy What you need: Kalita Wave Filter 30g of coffee 525g of water (filtered is best) Carafe or large mug Kitchen scale Timer Kettle (preferably gooseneck) Grinder LETS GET STARTED! 1. Heat 525g of water between 200 F and 205 F (3 to 5 min off boil). You will use 500g to brew the coffee, and the rest will be used to rinse your filter. 2. Grind your coffee ( 30g ) to a medium, or coarse-sand setting 3. Rinse the filter with 25g hot water to remove any papery taste 4. Add ground coffee and give it a little shake to flatten out the coffee bed 5. Pour just enough water ( 60g to 80g ) to let your coffee de-gas, or bloom. After pouring, wait 30 to 45 seconds. The fresher the coffee, the longer it will bloom! 6. Pour up to 250g slowly, using small concentric circles. Begin in the middle and slowly work your way outwards in circles, always with a consistent, gentle pour. This first 250g should be poured by 1.5 min. 7. When youre 1.5 min into the brewing process, youre ready to pour the remainder of your hot water. For this stage, only pour 50g of water every 20 seconds. Keep going until your scale reads 500g of water - aim to be finished pouring at about 2.5 minutes . 8. Let the water drain. If the grind size is correct, it will finish brewing at around 3.5 minutes . If it finishes earlier than 3 minutes, make the grind slightly finer next time. If it finishes later than 4 minutes, make the grind slightly coarser next time. 9. And finally.
